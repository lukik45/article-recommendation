parent falling out and seeing her father a an intelligent scientist compared to her mother beth came to idolize her father and blamed her mother for chasing off the dad with the gut to leave it is revealed in the abcof beth that at some point of her childhood beth became an insane and psychotic little girl she began to ask to her father rick to create toy like weapon to harm other child being an adult beth excused that she asked that to spend time with her father rick aware that the increasing danger that would represent his daughter created a dream world for his daughter froopyland in order to keep the other child of the neighborhood safe beth managed to take one of her friend tommy to froopyland where according to tommy she pushed the child into a honey swamp in an act of jealously with tommy and his good relationship with his father then she auto convinced herself that tommy got lost in froopyland beth aspired to become a heart surgeon a an adult but during high school when she wa already 17 year old she went to prom dance with her classmate jerry smith possibly out of pity or possibly out of manipulation of rick hoping to prompt the later conception of mortys beth and jerry had sex on prom night and she became impregnated with her first and only daughter summer she contemplated aborting the fetus later justifying that everybody think about it but managed to get into college and become a veterinary surgeon specializing in horse eventually finding work at st equis hospital she also decided to marry her boyfriend jerry and a few year later

surgeon at st equis hospital cause her to spend le time with her husband and child feeling that coddling them would make them dependent or end up like her husband sometime after the abcof beth rick cloned her resulting in two beth it is unknown which beth is the original and which one is the clone though it ha been implied by dan harmon and the episode rick potion 9 and the whirly dirly conspiracy that jerry and bethrelationship wa more stable before rick came back into her life appearance beth is a slender woman with shoulder length blonde hair she wear a red collar shirt blue pant and white shoe a a little girl beth wore overall with a red shirt long white sock and black mary janes a well a a green hair clip and two different colored wristband personality beth is an intelligent ambitious and independent woman who suffers from a variety of deep seated insecurity a dedicated veterinary horse surgeon she is the familymain breadwinner and often try to do the best for her family based on this sense of responsibility she is highly insecure about her profession a a horse surgeon and is quick to snap at the implication she is not a real surgeon or a real veterinarian she may share this belief wishing she had been able to continue her medical education to become a real doctor in rixty minute nonetheless she is very dedicated to her job even beyond a a source of income and wa willing to give up her own pride to help successfully save a deerlife in a rickle in time although beth can sometimes be derisive of what she see a weakness dependence or emotional vulnerability she can still be compassionate and caring at time more so than her father when she and jerry accidentally hit a deer her first concern were to help and assist it and beth would stop at nothing to bring it back to health she often express grave concern for mortyeducation and health when they are not related to rick and is considerate of the consequence on her child of her leaving jerry she ha generally considered her family her first priority and ha defined her life around her marriage to jerry which ha at time driven her marital regret her dedication to her family can fade quickly if she feel patronized devalued or that she or another family member such a morty or rick is threatened beth ha a superiority complex believing herself at time to be above others a a way of hiding her insecurity she ha extended this behaviour to those such a her son morty particularly when he is shown taking care of his own son and her husband who unwittingly feed her insecurity by implying she wa not a real surgeon her genius fatherclear preference for her over her idiot husband ha in turn fed her feeling of superiority especially towards jerry she also exhibited resentment towards being patronized during her surgical work such a by her co worker davin when he let her know they re losing a patient or when another veterinarian implies she can not save a deer these feeling of superiority however seem to disappear quickly when rick is removed from her life or even when she merely feel more confident in herself a a result of her fatherdisappearance beth ha come to fixate on exceptionalism and intelligence and ha a fear of abandonment resulting in a deep seated desire to keep her father in her life a a result she is generally willing to put up with rick and his need without sarcasm or argument rationalizing his experiment and behavior she can become defensive and even insecure about this when challenged by it a in the wedding squanchers she call jerry a dumb asshole for proposing the idea that rick doesn t care for the family and so in turn they have no reason to treat him with care when meeting dr wong in pickle rick however she largely bragged about her father a a scientist and believed that the reason he turned himself into a pickle had nothing to do with the fact that he wanted to avoid family therapy which ended up being debunked a he did turn himself into a pickle to evade it however she ha some limit even for his behavior and ha given him ultimatum in pilot and auto erotic assimilation which he ha ultimately followed so she is not entirely defensive of her fatherbehaviors nevertheless the long lasting emotional scar embedded into beth by ricksudden abandonment left her to seek comfort in more reliable person such a jerry and to withhold confidence in herself her relationship jerry is extremely rocky beth and jerry have remained together partially due to the fact that jerry is the only man who ha not abandoned her she and jerry share a number of common goal generally around doing what is best for their family but these goal are strained by their disagreement on how to achieve these end she is often critical of his idea and suggests that she feel held back or unappreciated by him their disagreement over rickliving situation with them is an extremely frequent source of tension in many case jerry is often the more sentimental and nurturing one who call out rick for being a negative impact on morty and beth is often the one justifying his action beth ha notably inherited her fathertendency to rely on alcohol to control stress drinking wine briefly in meeseeks and destroy and amid more stressful situation very heavily in both rixty minute at the end of total rickall and in the rickshank rickdemption she also express excitement at the offer to go out for a drink with rick in pickle rick seeming to overlook both of her child a separate flashback in total rickall also show her suffering from a severe hangover causing her to whiplash a bottle at summer during her picture day giving her a black eye a a result in addition beth can be highly sarcastic at time such a when she predicted snuffle increased intelligence would backfire in the episode lawnmower dog in the season 3 episode the abcof beth an even further layer of bethpersonality wa revealed rick discloses that she had a tumultuous and destructive childhood only exacerbated by her murderous and sociopath tendency which rick accredits to his own mental state and whose behavior a a role model and eventual disappearance no doubt contributed to despite having acclimated towards a relatively normal life in adulthood this layer again reveals itself when she go to confront her childhood friend tommy and end the chaos ruling over her former imaginary paradise froopyland during the chaos she then realizes that while her childhood self idolized rick and wanted to be like him rick remains a deeply flawed individual and by some cruel twist of fate she turned out exactly like him needlessly destructive it is implied that the both of them deeply misunderstand the world a it appears to the majority who can easily adapt to it and live in accordance to a lifestyle set out for them through their own choice who know what they want and their life direction even if only for the fact that that they allow themselves to experience satisfaction happiness and completion instead of only sort of contempt towards an ordinary life in some misguided attempt to overcome it realizing that in divorcing jerry and coming to term with the way she is that there is no one and nothing holding her back from a living a life of self determination in accordance to her true broken identity rick proposes that beth resolve her identity issue through exploring the multiverse while an identical clone take her place for however long she is gone or even a lifetime it is not disclosed whether or not beth decides to remain it is likely that she chose the latter based on the scene that followed though the rickchurian mortydate put this into further debate the episode also revealed that beth wa very lonely a a little girl and may very well still be having asked rick to make her a whip that would make people like her and a sentient switchblade she wa also envious of her friend tommy and his father who wa present in his life which lead her to abandon him in froopyland mirroring her fatherimage and roused her to become a better person by her own standard overall beth is a complexly conflicted woman with several layer of contradictory nature firstly she envisions herself much like her morally bankrupt father rick admiring him for his unlimited intellect and independence which at first seems to stem from confidence of being virtually the smartest being in the universe however throughout the vast year of interstellar madness and chaos the universe ha to offer she realises rickcarelessness core origin lie in the awareness of how insignificant it all is his knowledge of the multiverse and endless alternate dimension with different version of everyone make him believe nothing matter and treat relationship and the human need for bond a pointless yet while beth is also intelligent enough to solve a complex issue and agree many time with her father she chooses to rather go with the ignorance and simpler curve in spite of her blood beth see life worth living even if it end up a nothing more than a tiny speck on the hourglass contradictory to her ideal version of herself a top surgeon and independent woman beth end up with the largest contrast to her own character and value jerry though facing serious marriage struggle like unintentional pregnancy from unprotected intercourse from the merger age of 17 a husband that for all his noble intention isn t especially smart and with misguided intention and sometimes serious issue urging divorce she ultimately find more comfort from jerry than she doe from rickrecognition for while rickattention and praise might boost her confidence and uncertainty greatly it is only temporary the love from a simple man such a her husband is so easy and pure in itself that she benefit more from it than seeking approval from her lonely drunk and careless father secondly bethlargest flaw is her insecure feeling of abandonment left by rick in her quest to reconnect with her long deserted father beth manages to destroy most of the good thing she had obtained without his presence a surprisingly adequate job given the circumstance from the high school pregnancy two child that she love and a unique marriage that despite all it difficulty provides comfort in season 3 she embrace a life without jerry and in the end she end up only stressed and uncertain when trying to re create the lost year between herself and rick by the end she embrace the fact that jerry is child like easily misguided insecure slightly belove avarege intelligence and somewhat pathetic and instead relish in being loved by man unconditionally like other faulty animated marriage like homer marge from the simpson beth think jerry is just a child that doe not know better admiring his effort to make up even if badly executed the origin of her reason to live with a man very much unlike herself could stem from her deep vulnerability when it come to being alone either way beth retains better trait and confidence from the man that never will leave her side than the mysterious father that really hold no interest in anyone besides himself for whatever the reason finally for all the bad thing beth inherit form her father alcoholism negligence unemotional attachment rude cold behaviour etc she manages to rise above the negative aspect which make rick rick while with keeping his strength intelligence bravery self reliance etc she start with a happy childhood until losing her mother and eventually her father which leaf her mingle alone for twenty year she is forced to grow up by herself and raise a family she wa unprepared for however it is her family that prof she succeeded even if it is a distorted vision of her future self her love is ultimately her greatest difference form her father and lack of knowledge or interest in treating thing a insignificant grant her more happiness than rick end up with relationship romance jerry beth met jerry in high school and had unprotected sex on prom night resulting in the pregnancy that produced their first and only daughter summer they become married since that incident eventually producing their second child and only son morty three year later their relationship is very rocky and strained due to the fact that both of them missed out on fulfilling their dream due to poor decision when they were teenager a when jerry put on a headset that allows him to view many reality in rixty minute he realizes that without beth he would have became a successful director beth often contemplates leaving jerry to pursue her own dream and happiness mentioning taking a trip or a break while jerry still love her and often try to keep their marriage together beth belief her father to be a better influence on their child than jerry which is another reason she think he should live with them jerry doesn t always seem to respect her occupation a horse surgeon and occasionally ha freudian slip about it which greatly offends her and she is often frustrated by jerryinsecurities and immature action ironically despite her continous frustration with jerry simple nature she herself also bear clear insecurity especially with her father due to her lonely childhood wether rick wa present or not beth doe have a vulnerability with abandonment this is one of the reason that beth married and stayed with jerry for more than 15 year because unlike rick he stay with her no matter what in spite of denial of rickclearly horrid character numerous evidence prof that jerry is right concerning bethfears of abandonment and definitely with her father being far from the ideal person or parent in rixty minute jerry and beth both get to see an alternate version of themselves in a different reality and find themselves unsatisfied with their current life leading them to eventually decide that splitting up would be inevitable however the alternate jerry and beth eventually realize that they are miserable without one another and get together after year apart seeing this renewed jerry and bethrelationship and they opted not to split up in the rickshank rickdemption jerry took a stand against rickbehavior towards the family apparent manipulation of bethfather issue in order to live rent free and his frequently putting their child in danger he told beth that it wa him or rick which led to the two deciding to divorce in the rickchurian mortydate beth visit her husband when she suffers from identity crisis and he reflects on a high school date they had and she end up kissing him a thanks they decide to get back together and hide from rick who still track them down but begrudgingly accepts their choice at the end they are living together again with both being happier and beth defended jerry from rickinsults during childrick of mort beth and jerry have problem but jerry save his wife from falling though beth refuse sex a gratitude when rick wa criticizing jerry beth for once doesn t defend her father and instead take her husbanddefense by voicing how she wa impressed with jerry because saved her life while criticizing rick this brings a smile to jerryface in season 5 beth and jerry appear more loving while openly claiming to watch pornography together thanks to dr wongtherapy and due to their new sexual nature they have a three way with mr nimbus family rick not much is known about the relationship of beth and her father rick prior to the event of the series jerry insinuates that beth wa raised like a reptile by rick suggesting that his method of parenting wa very unorthodox it is known that he left her mother for unknown reason beth is very happy that her father came back into her life sometime prior to pilot she is usually defensive of him when jerry badmouths him and is largely convinced that rick is good for the family when she came to realize that rick wa indeed a bad influence on morty and agreed with jerry to send him to a nursing home morty seemed to exhibit superhuman intelligence actually the result of dissolving mega seed further convincing her to keep him around beth affectionately celebrates the one year anniversary of rickreturn in close rick counter of the rick kind with ufo shaped pancake and despite her usual independence seems to dote on him and his alternate self in the same episode also multiple rick seem to like beth and compliment her for her kindness however this beth is not the same beth in rick potion 9 who come to the conclusion that her father rick is a selfish irresponsible as after he turned everyone on earth into monster and abandoned she jerry and summer in the season 2 finale the wedding squanchers beth get a closer look at her fatherpersonal life and try her best to keep jerry from ruining her chance of going on adventure with him more often later in the episode beth is heartbroken to find that rick abandoned her a second time little did she know that this time he turned himself in to protect her and her family from the federation when the family is taken back to earth by the galactic federation she burst into tear at the same time in the episode rickself sacrifice proved that he actually doe care about her beth also seems to enjoy rickinventions and appreciates the help he give her she allows rick to stay rent free in her home due to the fact that she doesn t want him leaving her again that is the same reason why she disagreed with jerry so strongly and wept when he suggested that the family turn in rick to the galactic federation so that they can go back home to earth in the wedding squanchers in the season 3 premiere the rickshank rickdemption when jerry finally give beth the ultimatum of choosing him or rick beth chooses rick leading to their divorce shortly after beth insists to rick that the divorce would be good for jerry and the family after he express remorse rick later admits to morty that he had a hand in manipulating this because jerry went against him in the whirly dirly conspiracy morty lash out on beth for her distance towards him and summer he blame this on her relationship with rick telling her that she doesn t need to prove herself to be worthy of ricklove by acting essentially just like him a it is making her appear just a narcissistic and irresponsible and that while shetrying to gain rickapproval shehurting him and summer beth believed she needed to prove herself to rick because of how rarely he ever tell her he love her he admits this to jaguar in pickle rick rick also admitted in the same episode to jerry that he belief jerry impregnating beth ruined her chance of being successful and detests him for his detachment to his daughter bethawareness of her mistreatment of her child may drive her farther away from rick a she will likely stop trying to get him to love her and instead find solace in her relationship with her child in the episode the abcof beth after beth and rick clone her childhood friend tommy and save his father from being executed they share a long awaited and progressive moment with each other beth discovers that all her life shebeen lying to herself that her father is a good man and tried desperately to be just like him she realizes that she doesn t want to be like him anymore and that she want to be herself rick finally tell her that he genuinely love her although in his own way and prof this to her by giving her an ultimatum he would clone her and let her leave to do what she want or she could stay and continue to care for the family it is likely that beth chose the latter option based on the scene that followed grazing her finger across the photo attached to the fridge beth smile at each picture a picture of mr poopybutthole her and jerry on their wedding day rick summer and lastly morty whose picture she rest her finger on the longest due to this suggestion in the rickchurian mortydate beth began to suffer from identity crisis despite rick constantly telling her she is real her spiral cause her to turn to jerry and reconcile with and hide from rick but he still find them forcing beth to confront him beth tell rick if she is a clone he should just kill her and get it over with or go to another dimension and be with another version of her however rick simply informs her she is his daughter and she is relieved though put off when he tell her he wa actually planning to kill jerry but relented in the end jerry move back in and rick begrudgingly accepts this while beth force him to watch his tone to her husband before she and the family laugh at rickexpense showing how much she moved from her fathershadow in star mort rickturn of the jerri after meeting clone beth and both of them dealing with rickconstant lie she loses a great amount of respect for him morty beth know that her son morty is not very intelligent and want him to succeed in school she ha no problem allowing rick to take morty on most adventure believing rick is not only teaching him valuable life skill and improving his intelligence but that he is the only friend morty ha she belief that morty wa filled with jerryinsecurities a a result of jerryoverly nurturing method of raising him and consequently she is largely absent from mortylife despite this beth doe seem to consistently care about mortywell being a she asks if morty is getting sick in pilot and is deeply concerned about the fact that he doe not do well in school or have any friend she wa even willing to sacrifice her relationship with rick so that morty could do better in school in the same episode in rick potion 9 beth c 137 admits that without her son morty and her father rick around she is much happier and seems indifferent to her sonfate it isn t unlikely that in the case that the same event were to occur in the dimension c 131 a they had in dimension c 137 that this beth would feel the same way however in the rickshank rickdemption that same beth along with her husband and daughter were going to kill the summer of the replacement dimension and keep morty meaning they missed him during their time apart in something ricked this way come beth communicates with morty through text reminding him of jerryintellectual insecurity so that he will accept jerryoffer to help him with his science project implying that they have a close relationship and have a mutual understanding for each other and jerry apart from this their relationship ha yet to be explored in any other significant detail in the series that is until the whirly dirly conspiracy in the whirly dirly conspiracy morty lash out on beth for her distance towards him and summer he blame this on her relationship with rick telling her that she doesn t need to prove herself to be worthy of ricklove by acting essentially just like him a it is making her appear just a narcissistic and irresponsible and that while shetrying to gain rickapproval shehurting him and summer upon realizing this beth institute change and later us the morphizer to make herself giant put her skin inside out and comfort summer who wa cry and really needed her at the moment bethawareness of her mistreatment of her child ha initiated a change in her making her more motherly and understanding this change will likely bring her closer to morty a well a summer but farther from rick in mortymind blower it wa revealed that beth prefers her daughter summer over her son morty beth wa trapped in a situation where an evil alien from another dimension wa planning on killing one of her two child and graced her with the choice of which one life without any hesitation beth immediately demanded that her daughter summer be the one who survives morty wa shocked at his motherchoice a wa the alien but luckily rick rescued his daughter and grandchild and erased her sonmemories though he recalled this but forgot again the reason of bethchoice is because she is jealous of his closer relationship with rick however it is apparent beth still love her son due to her behavior in the rickchurian mortydate where she wa happy to be a family again it is also likely that without her father rickinfluence morty could be bethfavorite in season 1 of the series before rickimpact on the family cemented beth consistently showed concern for her son mortyhealth and well being and in the episode the abcof beth after talking with her father about his offer to create a

homeless manbeth after rick tell her shenot a clone behind the scene dan harmon ha frequently offered insight into bethcharacterisation since early around the release of the first season observing that it is beth whose behavior enables rick to be able to take morty on their adventure oh my god beth is so messed up i guess i know more about her than what you ve learned so far but you know she got pregnant at seventeen you know the guy that knocked her up wouldn t have been her first choice you know her motherout of the picture but that her dad who wa out of the picture when she wa a child is now back in the picture and that unlike jerry she seems relatively fine with his influence on her learning disabled son it seems like she d rather her son risk his life with her insane father than end up being like her husband thatreally really fucked up we know that kid blame themselves for their parent breaking up thatpretty standard psychology but from there we have different mechanism for coping with the blame and one of the strategy we see people employ in the face of an absentee parent is a deification of the parent that take le responsibility beth think her dad is better than her mother because her dad had the brain and gut to leave her thatreally really fucked up rickdaughter is more fucked up than rick and fucked up because of rick don t you worry about that i wa like why would that be the case why would any parent let this crazy man disappear through clearly dangerous portal with their son and after talking about it with justin for a while i realized the most important thing about that show for me which is that rick left at one point in bethchildhood and beth blamed her mother for rickabsence kid can sometimes idolize their worst parent and blame their supportive parent for chasing off the dad with the gut to leave sometimes they don t even admit it to themselves but they say my dadso fucking cool he got the fuck out of here and my momsuch a bitch shealways asking me to clean my room thatwhy dad left she probably asked him to clean his room and in bethcase shea horse heart surgeon shenot a real surgeon shea horse heart surgeon because she got pregnant at 17 and she fetishizes exceptionality she belief that rick a crazy a he is is the better of her two parent even though she wa raised by her mother and she blame her motherunremarkability on her fatherdeparture and will do anything to keep her father back in her life and if morty need to risk his life traipsing across the galaxy with her insane alcoholic father itbetter than morty growing up in safety and ending up like her mother or her husband jerry who she considers to be unremarkable and unredemptive and therefore undeserving of her affection so the center of the show even though we don t address it at all is this really fucked up woman who i love more than any character on that show because she would have been a brain surgeon but she got pregnant at 17 and so shedefensive about how shea horse heart surgeon because it take le school to do that and sheselfish and shecold but shesmart she wear the pant in the family and shewitty and she doesn t like herself she bother to love her father and that keep everything feasible because otherwise it would all fall apart you d go why wouldn t anyone say stop doing that stop taking my son on these adventure the answer is because jerry is terrified that beth will leave him and beth is terrified that rick will leave her and round and round we go and so we have this beautiful suspension that could provide u with hundred of episode separation from jerry is a blessing and curse for her she ha been defining her life by her marriage straight out of high school to this unremarkable man that she in her mind compare to her mother while fetishising exceptionality in the form of her father that excuse being removed it just allows u to put the spotlight on beth a little bit and start asking a few more question about her

multiple time for mortyeducation and health and despite her marital regret she often considers the consequence of leaving jerry she generally ha considered her family to be her first priority however

generally around doing what is best for their family these goal are strained by their disagreement on how to achieve these end beth is quite critical of jerryideas and often display sarcasm such a when she predicted snuffle increased intelligence would backfire she also feel under appreciated by jerry at time or that their relationship is tying her down their disagreement over rickliving situation with them is an extremely frequent source of tension while in many case including with their son jerry is often the more sentimental and nurturing one when the issue come to rick she is often the one justifying his action a recurring theme in their relationship is beth desiring to take a break or even a trip from jerry who unwittingly feed her insecurity by implying she is not a real surgeon while her father seems to value her highly over her idiot husband in turn feeding her feeling of superiority she also highly resents being patronised by her co worker devin when he let her

fervent desire to keep her father in her life stemming from the fact that he wa absent from her life for twenty year after he left her and her mother for unknown reason a a result she ha abandonment issue and deeply wish to keep him in her life it is one of the reason her relationship with jerry is so strained she mock him because it give her rick approval she is generally willing to put up with

father rick prior to the event of the series jerry insinuates that beth wa raised like a reptile by rick suggesting that his method of parenting wa very unorthodox her father wa the rick known a rick prime who after inventing the portal gun abandoned his wife and daughter forever to live like a god when rick from dimension c 137 came into her life sometime prior to pilot she wa very happy that her father had come back she had conflicting feeling about rick due to falsely believing that this relatively more compassionate rick and the rick who abandoned her were one and the same but despite unspoken resentment she belief him to be stronger than her mother because he had the strength to leave she is usually defensive of him when jerry badmouths him and is largely convinced that rick is good for the family when she came to realize that rick wa indeed a bad influence on morty and agreed with jerry to send him to a nursing home morty seemed to exhibit superhuman intelligence actually the result of dissolving megaseeds convincing her to keep him around however in rick potion no 9 she come to the conclusion that her father rick is a selfish and irresponsible as in the rickshank rickdemption she and her husband and daughter voiced their deep hatred of rick for what he ha done to their world morty beth know that her son morty is not very intelligent and want him to succeed in school she ha no problem allowing rick to take morty on most adventure believing rick is not only teaching him valuable life skill and improving his intelligence but that he is the only friend morty

consistently care about mortywell being a she asks if morty is getting sick in pilot and is concerned about the fact that he doe not do well in school or have any friend their relationship ha yet to explored in any detail in the series however in rick potion no 9 she admits that without her son morty and her father rick around she is much happier and seems indifferent to her sonfate however in

multiple time for mortyeducation and health and despite her marital regret she often considers the consequence of leaving jerry she generally ha considered her family to be her first priority however this quality can fade out quickly if she feel patronized devalued or that she or another family member such a morty or rick is threatened while both she and jerry share a number of common goal generally around doing what is best for their family these goal are strained by their disagreement on how to achieve these end beth is quite critical of jerryideas and often display sarcasm such a when she predicted snuffle increased intelligence would backfire she also feel under appreciated by jerry at time or that their relationship is tying her down their disagreement over rickliving situation with them is an extremely frequent source of tension while in many case including with their son jerry is often the more sentimental and nurturing one when the issue come to rick she is often the one justifying his action a recurring theme in their relationship is beth desiring to take a break or even a trip from jerry who unwittingly feed her insecurity by implying she is not a real surgeon while her father seems to value her highly over her idiot husband in turn feeding her feeling of superiority she also highly resents being patronised by her co worker devin when he let her know they re losing a patient constantly these feeling of superiority however seem to disappear when rick is removed from her life or even when she merely feel more confident in herself beth ha a fervent desire to keep her father in her life stemming from the fact that he wa absent from her life for twenty year after he left her and her mother for unknown reason a a result she ha abandonment issue and deeply wish to keep him in her life it is one of the reason her relationship with jerry is so strained she mock him because it give her rick approval she is generally willing to put up with

jerry destroys the portal gun and appears to want to drive off or possibly kill the summer from the replacement dimension relationship rick not much is known about the relationship of beth and her father rick prior to the event of the series jerry insinuates that beth wa raised like a reptile by rick suggesting that his method of parenting wa very unorthodox her father wa the rick known a rick prime who after inventing the portal gun abandoned his wife and daughter forever to live like a god when rick from dimension c 137 came into her life sometime prior to pilot she wa very happy that her father had come back she had conflicting feeling about rick due to falsely believing that this relatively more compassionate rick and the rick who abandoned her were one and the same but despite unspoken resentment she belief him to be stronger than her mother because he had the strength to leave she is usually defensive of him when jerry badmouths him and is largely convinced that rick is good for the family when she came to realize that rick wa indeed a bad influence on morty and agreed with jerry to send him to a nursing home morty seemed to exhibit superhuman intelligence actually the result of dissolving megaseeds convincing her to keep him around however in rick potion no 9 she come to the conclusion that her father rick is a selfish and irresponsible as in the rickshank

they were teenager jerry seems to still love beth quite a lot and try hard to keep their marriage together but beth more than often contemplates leaving jerry to pursue her own happiness and dream beth is angered by the fact that jerry doe not consider her job a a horse surgeon a being a real surgeon and is often frustrated by jerryinsecurities and immature action she describes loving jerry a hard work and that she sort of love him in rick potion no 9 however their spark seems to be relit when he save her from her infected coworker and blast a way through a huge monster to get to summer

leave it is revealed in the abcof beth that at some point of her childhood beth became an insane and psychotic little girl she began to ask to her father rick to create toy like weapon to harm other child being an adult beth excused that she asked that to spend time with her father rick aware that the increasing danger that would represent his daughter created a dream world for his daughter froopyland in order to keep the other child of the neighborhood safe beth managed to take one of her friend tommy to froopyland where according to tommy she pushed the child into a honey swamp in an act of jealously with tommy and his good relationship with his father then she auto convinced herself that tommy got lost in froopyland beth aspired to become a heart surgeon a an adult but during

surgeon at st equis hospital cause her to spend le time with her husband and child feeling that coddling them would make them dependent or end up like her husband sometime after the abcof beth rick cloned her resulting in two beth it is unknown which beth is the original and which one is the clone though it ha been implied by dan harmon and the episode rick potion 9 and the whirly dirly conspiracy that jerry and bethrelationship wa more stable before rick came back into her life appearance beth is a slender woman with shoulder length blonde hair she wear a red collar shirt blue pant and white shoe a a little girl beth wore overall with a red shirt long white sock and black mary janes a well a a green hair clip and two different colored wristband personality beth is an intelligent ambitious and independent woman who suffers from a variety of deep seated insecurity a dedicated veterinary horse surgeon she is the familymain breadwinner and often try to do the best for her family based on this sense of responsibility she is highly insecure about her profession a a horse surgeon and is quick to snap at the implication she is not a real surgeon or a real veterinarian she may share this belief wishing she had been able to continue her medical education to become a real doctor in rixty minute nonetheless she is very dedicated to her job even beyond a a source of income and wa willing to give up her own pride to help successfully save a deerlife in a rickle in time although beth can sometimes be derisive of what she see a weakness dependence or emotional vulnerability she can still be compassionate and caring at time more so than her father when she and jerry accidentally hit a deer her first concern were to help and assist it and beth would stop at nothing to bring it back to health she often express grave concern for mortyeducation and health when they are not related to rick and is considerate of the consequence on her child of her leaving jerry she ha generally considered her family her first priority and ha defined her life around her marriage to jerry which ha at time driven her marital regret her dedication to her family can fade quickly if she feel patronized devalued or that she or another family member such a morty or rick is threatened beth ha a superiority complex believing herself at time to be above others a a way of hiding her insecurity she ha extended this behaviour to those such a her son morty particularly when he is shown taking care of his own son and her husband who unwittingly feed her insecurity by implying she wa not a real surgeon her genius fatherclear preference for her over her idiot husband ha in turn fed her feeling of superiority especially towards jerry she also exhibited resentment towards being patronized during her surgical work such a by her co worker davin when he let her know they re losing a patient or when another veterinarian implies she can not save a deer these feeling of superiority however seem to disappear quickly when rick is removed from her life or even when she merely feel more confident in herself a a result of her fatherdisappearance beth ha come to fixate on exceptionalism and intelligence and ha a fear of abandonment resulting in a deep seated desire to keep her father in her life a a result she is generally willing to put up with rick and his need without sarcasm or argument rationalizing his experiment and behavior she can become defensive and even insecure about this when challenged by it a in the wedding squanchers she call jerry a dumb asshole for proposing the idea that rick doesn t care for the family and so in turn they have no reason to treat him with care when meeting dr wong in pickle rick however she largely bragged about her father a a scientist and believed that the reason he turned himself into a pickle had nothing to do with the fact that he wanted to avoid family therapy which ended up being debunked a he did turn himself into a pickle to evade it however she ha some limit even for his behavior and ha given him ultimatum in pilot and auto erotic assimilation which he ha ultimately followed so she is not entirely defensive of her fatherbehaviors nevertheless the long lasting emotional scar embedded into beth by ricksudden abandonment left her to seek comfort in more reliable person such a jerry and to withhold confidence in herself her relationship jerry is extremely rocky beth and jerry have remained together partially due to the fact that jerry is the only man who ha not abandoned her she and jerry share a number of common goal generally around doing what is best for their family but these goal are strained by their disagreement on how to achieve these end she is often critical of his idea and suggests that she feel held back or unappreciated by him their disagreement over rickliving situation with them is an extremely frequent source of tension in many case jerry is often the more sentimental and nurturing one who call out rick for being a negative impact on morty and beth is often the one justifying his action beth ha notably inherited her fathertendency to rely on alcohol to control stress drinking wine briefly in meeseeks and destroy and amid more stressful situation very heavily in both rixty minute at the end of total rickall and in the rickshank rickdemption she also express excitement at the offer to go out for a drink with rick in pickle rick seeming to overlook both of her child a separate flashback in total rickall also show her suffering from a severe hangover causing her to whiplash a bottle at summer during her picture day giving her a black eye a a result in addition beth can be highly sarcastic at time such a when she predicted snuffle increased intelligence would backfire in the episode lawnmower dog in the season 3 episode the abcof beth an even further layer of bethpersonality wa revealed rick discloses that she had a tumultuous and destructive childhood only exacerbated by her murderous and sociopath tendency which rick accredits to his own mental state and whose behavior a a role model and eventual disappearance no doubt contributed to despite having acclimated towards a relatively normal life in adulthood this layer again reveals itself when she go to confront her childhood friend tommy and end the chaos ruling over her former imaginary paradise froopyland during the chaos she then realizes that while her childhood self idolized rick and wanted to be like him rick remains a deeply flawed individual and by some cruel twist of fate she turned out exactly like him needlessly destructive it is implied that the both of them deeply misunderstand the world a it appears to the majority who can easily adapt to it and live in accordance to a lifestyle set out for them through their own choice who know what they want and their life direction even if only for the fact that that they allow themselves to experience satisfaction happiness and completion instead of only sort of contempt towards an ordinary life in some misguided attempt to overcome it realizing that in divorcing jerry and coming to term with the way she is that there is no one and nothing holding her back from a living a life of self determination in accordance to her true broken identity rick proposes that beth resolve her identity issue through exploring the multiverse while an identical clone take her place for however long she is gone or even a lifetime it is not disclosed whether or not beth decides to remain it is likely that she chose the latter based on the scene that followed though the rickchurian mortydate put this into further debate the episode also revealed that beth wa very lonely a a little girl and may very well still be having asked rick to make her a whip that would make people like her and a sentient switchblade she wa also envious of her friend tommy and his father who wa present in his life which lead her to abandon him in froopyland mirroring her fatherimage and roused her to become a better person by her own standard overall beth is a complexly conflicted woman with several layer of contradictory nature firstly she envisions herself much like her morally bankrupt father rick admiring him for his unlimited intellect and independence which at first seems to stem from confidence of being virtually the smartest being in the universe however throughout the vast year of interstellar madness and chaos the universe ha to offer she realises rickcarelessness core origin lie in the awareness of how insignificant it all is his knowledge of the multiverse and endless alternate dimension with different version of everyone make him believe nothing matter and treat relationship and the human need for bond a pointless yet while beth is also intelligent enough to solve a complex issue and agree many time with her father she chooses to rather go with the ignorance and simpler curve in spite of her blood beth see life worth living even if it end up a nothing more than a tiny speck on the hourglass contradictory to her ideal version of herself a top surgeon and independent woman beth end up with the largest contrast to her own character and value jerry though facing serious marriage struggle like unintentional pregnancy from unprotected intercourse from the merger age of 17 a husband that for all his noble intention isn t especially smart and with misguided intention and sometimes serious issue urging divorce she ultimately find more comfort from jerry than she doe from rickrecognition for while rickattention and praise might boost her confidence and uncertainty greatly it is only temporary the love from a simple man such a her husband is so easy and pure in itself that she benefit more from it than seeking approval from her lonely drunk and careless father secondly bethlargest flaw is her insecure feeling of abandonment left by rick in her quest to reconnect with her long deserted father beth manages to destroy most of the good thing she had obtained without his presence a surprisingly adequate job given the circumstance from the high school pregnancy two child that she love and a unique marriage that despite all it difficulty provides comfort in season 3 she embrace a life without jerry and in the end she end up only stressed and uncertain when trying to re create the lost year between herself and rick by the end she embrace the fact that jerry is child like easily misguided insecure slightly belove avarege intelligence and somewhat pathetic and instead relish in being loved by man unconditionally like other faulty animated marriage like homer marge from the simpson beth think jerry is just a child that doe not know better admiring his effort to make up even if badly executed the origin of her reason to live with a man very much unlike herself could stem from her deep vulnerability when it come to being alone either way beth retains better trait and confidence from the man that never will leave her side than the mysterious father that really hold no interest in anyone besides himself for whatever the reason finally for all the bad thing beth inherit form her father alcoholism negligence unemotional attachment rude cold behaviour etc she manages to rise above the negative aspect which make rick rick while with keeping his strength intelligence bravery self reliance etc she start with a happy childhood until losing her mother and eventually her father which leaf her mingle alone for twenty year she is forced to grow up by herself and raise a family she wa unprepared for however it is her family that prof she succeeded even if it is a distorted vision of her future self her love is ultimately her greatest difference form her father and lack of knowledge or interest in treating thing a insignificant grant her more happiness than rick end up with relationship romance jerry beth met jerry in high school and had unprotected sex on prom night resulting in the pregnancy that produced their first and only daughter summer they become married since that incident eventually producing their second child and only son morty three year later their relationship is very rocky and strained due to the fact that both of them missed out on fulfilling their dream due to poor decision when they were teenager a when jerry put on a headset that allows him to view many reality in rixty minute he realizes that without beth he would have became a successful director beth often contemplates leaving jerry to pursue her own dream and happiness mentioning taking a trip or a break while jerry still love her and often try to keep their marriage together beth belief her father to be a better influence on their child than jerry which is another reason she think he should live with them jerry doesn t always seem to respect her occupation a horse surgeon and occasionally ha freudian slip about it which greatly offends her and she is often frustrated by jerryinsecurities and immature action ironically despite her continous frustration with jerry simple nature she herself also bear clear insecurity especially with her father due to her lonely childhood wether rick wa present or not beth doe have a vulnerability with abandonment this is one of the reason that beth married and stayed with jerry for more than 15 year because unlike rick he stay with her no matter what in spite of denial of rickclearly horrid character numerous evidence prof that jerry is right concerning bethfears of abandonment and definitely with her father being far from the ideal person or parent in rixty minute jerry and beth both get to see an alternate version of themselves in a different reality and find themselves unsatisfied with their current life leading them to eventually decide that splitting up would be inevitable however the alternate jerry and beth eventually realize that they are miserable without one another and get together after year apart seeing this renewed jerry and bethrelationship and they opted not to split up in the rickshank rickdemption jerry took a stand against rickbehavior towards the family apparent manipulation of bethfather issue in order to live rent free and his frequently putting their child in danger he told beth that it wa him or rick which led to the two deciding to divorce in the rickchurian mortydate beth visit her husband when she suffers from identity crisis and he reflects on a high school date they had and she end up kissing him a thanks they decide to get back together and hide from rick who still track them down but begrudgingly accepts their choice at the end they are living together again with both being happier and beth defended jerry from rickinsults during childrick of mort beth and jerry have problem but jerry save his wife from falling though beth refuse sex a gratitude when rick wa criticizing jerry beth for once doesn t defend her father and instead take her husbanddefense by voicing how she wa impressed with jerry because saved her life while criticizing rick this brings a smile to jerryface in season 5 beth and jerry appear more loving while openly claiming to watch pornography together thanks to dr wongtherapy and due to their new sexual nature they have a three way with mr nimbus family rick not much is known about the relationship of beth and her father rick prior to the event of the series jerry insinuates that beth wa raised like a reptile by rick suggesting that his method of parenting wa very unorthodox it is known that he left her mother for unknown reason beth is very happy that her father came back into her life sometime prior to pilot she is usually defensive of him when jerry badmouths him and is largely convinced that rick is good for the family when she came to realize that rick wa indeed a bad influence on morty and agreed with jerry to send him to a nursing home morty seemed to exhibit superhuman intelligence actually the result of dissolving mega seed further convincing her to keep him around beth affectionately celebrates the one year anniversary of rickreturn in close rick counter of the rick kind with ufo shaped pancake and despite her usual independence seems to dote on him and his alternate self in the same episode also multiple rick seem to like beth and compliment her for her kindness however this beth is not the same beth in rick potion 9 who come to the conclusion that her father rick is a selfish irresponsible as after he turned everyone on earth into monster and abandoned she jerry and summer in the season 2 finale the wedding squanchers beth get a closer look at her fatherpersonal life and try her best to keep jerry from ruining her chance of going on adventure with him more often later in the episode beth is heartbroken to find that rick abandoned her a second time little did she know that this time he turned himself in to protect her and her family from the federation when the family is taken back to earth by the galactic federation she burst into tear at the same time in the episode rickself sacrifice proved that he actually doe care about her beth also seems to enjoy rickinventions and appreciates the help he give her she allows rick to stay rent free in her home due to the fact that she doesn t want him leaving her again that is the same reason why she disagreed with jerry so strongly and wept when he suggested that the family turn in rick to the galactic federation so that they can go back home to earth in the wedding squanchers in the season 3 premiere the rickshank rickdemption when jerry finally give beth the ultimatum of choosing him or rick beth chooses rick leading to their divorce shortly after beth insists to rick that the divorce would be good for jerry and the family after he express remorse rick later admits to morty that he had a hand in manipulating this because jerry went against him in the whirly dirly conspiracy morty lash out on beth for her distance towards him and summer he blame this on her relationship with rick telling her that she doesn t need to prove herself to be worthy of ricklove by acting essentially just like him a it is making her appear just a narcissistic and irresponsible and that while shetrying to gain rickapproval shehurting him and summer beth believed she needed to prove herself to rick because of how rarely he ever tell her he love her he admits this to jaguar in pickle rick rick also admitted in the same episode to jerry that he belief jerry impregnating beth ruined her chance of being successful and detests him for his detachment to his daughter bethawareness of her mistreatment of her child may drive her farther away from rick a she will likely stop trying to get him to love her and instead find solace in her relationship with her child in the episode the abcof beth after beth and rick clone her childhood friend tommy and save his father from being executed they share a long awaited and progressive moment with each other beth discovers that all her life shebeen lying to herself that her father is a good man and tried desperately to be just like him she realizes that she doesn t want to be like him anymore and that she want to be herself rick finally tell her that he genuinely love her although in his own way and prof this to her by giving her an ultimatum he would clone her and let her leave to do what she want or she could stay and continue to care for the family it is likely that beth chose the latter option based on the scene that followed grazing her finger across the photo attached to the fridge beth smile at each picture a picture of mr poopybutthole her and jerry on their wedding day rick summer and lastly morty whose picture she rest her finger on the longest due to this suggestion in the rickchurian mortydate beth began to suffer from identity crisis despite rick constantly telling her she is real her spiral cause her to turn to jerry and reconcile with and hide from rick but he still find them forcing beth to confront him beth tell rick if she is a clone he should just kill her and get it over with or go to another dimension and be with another version of her however rick simply informs her she is his daughter and she is relieved though put off when he tell her he wa actually planning to kill jerry but relented in the end jerry move back in and rick begrudgingly accepts this while beth force him to watch his tone to her husband before she and the family laugh at rickexpense showing how much she moved from her fathershadow in star mort rickturn of the jerri after meeting clone beth and both of them dealing with rickconstant lie she loses a great amount of respect for him morty beth know that her son morty is not very intelligent and want him to succeed in school she ha no problem allowing rick to take morty on most adventure believing rick is not only teaching him valuable life skill and improving his intelligence but that he is the only friend morty ha she belief that morty wa filled with jerryinsecurities a a result of jerryoverly nurturing method of raising him and consequently she is largely absent from mortylife despite this beth doe seem to consistently care about mortywell being a she asks if morty is getting sick in pilot and is deeply concerned about the fact that he doe not do well in school or have any friend she wa even willing to sacrifice her relationship with rick so that morty could do better in school in the same episode in rick potion 9 beth c 137 admits that without her son morty and her father rick around she is much happier and seems indifferent to her sonfate it isn t unlikely that in the case that the same event were to occur in the dimension c 131 a they had in dimension c 137 that this beth would feel the same way however in the rickshank rickdemption that same beth along with her husband and daughter were going to kill the summer of the replacement dimension and keep morty meaning they missed him during their time apart in something ricked this way come beth communicates with morty through text reminding him of jerryintellectual insecurity so that he will accept jerryoffer to help him with his science project implying that they have a close relationship and have a mutual understanding for each other and jerry apart from this their relationship ha yet to be explored in any other significant detail in the series that is until the whirly dirly conspiracy in the whirly dirly conspiracy morty lash out on beth for her distance towards him and summer he blame this on her relationship with rick telling her that she doesn t need to prove herself to be worthy of ricklove by acting essentially just like him a it is making her appear just a narcissistic and irresponsible and that while shetrying to gain rickapproval shehurting him and summer upon realizing this beth institute change and later us the morphizer to make herself giant put her skin inside out and comfort summer who wa cry and really needed her at the moment bethawareness of her mistreatment of her child ha initiated a change in her making her more motherly and understanding this change will likely bring her closer to morty a well a summer but farther from rick in mortymind blower it wa revealed that beth prefers her daughter summer over her son morty beth wa trapped in a situation where an evil alien from another dimension wa planning on killing one of her two child and graced her with the choice of which one life without any hesitation beth immediately demanded that her daughter summer be the one who survives morty wa shocked at his motherchoice a wa the alien but luckily rick rescued his daughter and grandchild and erased her sonmemories though he recalled this but forgot again the reason of bethchoice is because she is jealous of his closer relationship with rick however it is apparent beth still love her son due to her behavior in the rickchurian mortydate where she wa happy to be a family again it is also likely that without her father rickinfluence morty could be bethfavorite in season 1 of the series before rickimpact on the family cemented beth consistently showed concern for her son mortyhealth and well being and in the episode the abcof beth after talking with her father about his offer to create a clone of her beth still contemplating carry her hand carefully over all the individual picture of the family on the refrigerator this ended at her sonpicture who she looked at the longest and smiled at afterwards this could mean that beth doe indeed love her son morty during a rickconvenient mort beth ultimately show she doe love morty by voicing disapproval of his status with planetina because of the age gap despite her being unaging and his recklessness in getting involved with her morty became angry with beth after she demand planetina leave morty subsequently lashed out at her by voicing his adventure and how beth a well a the rest of the family doubt him and never let him be happy leaving beth stunned and somewhat guilty when morty and planetina break up beth overhearing the argument

homeless manbeth after rick tell her shenot a clone behind the scene dan harmon ha frequently offered insight into bethcharacterisation since early around the release of the first season observing that it is beth whose behavior enables rick to be able to take morty on their adventure oh my god beth is so messed up i guess i know more about her than what you ve learned so far but you know she got pregnant at seventeen you know the guy that knocked her up wouldn t have been her first choice you know her motherout of the picture but that her dad who wa out of the picture when she wa a child is now back in the picture and that unlike jerry she seems relatively fine with his influence on her learning disabled son it seems like she d rather her son risk his life with her insane father than end up being like her husband thatreally really fucked up we know that kid blame themselves for their parent breaking up thatpretty standard psychology but from there we have different mechanism for coping with the blame and one of the strategy we see people employ in the face of an absentee parent is a deification of the parent that take le responsibility beth think her dad is better than her mother because her dad had the brain and gut to leave her thatreally really fucked up rickdaughter is more fucked up than rick and fucked up because of rick don t you worry about that i wa like why would that be the case why would any parent let this crazy man disappear through clearly dangerous portal with their son and after talking about it with justin for a while i realized the most important thing about that show for me which is that rick left at one point in bethchildhood and beth blamed her mother for rickabsence kid can sometimes idolize their worst parent and blame their supportive parent for chasing off the dad with the gut to leave sometimes they don t even admit it to themselves but they say my dadso fucking cool he got the fuck out of here and my momsuch a bitch shealways asking me to clean my room thatwhy dad left she probably asked him to clean his room and in bethcase shea horse heart surgeon shenot a real surgeon shea horse heart surgeon because she got pregnant at 17 and she fetishizes exceptionality she belief that rick a crazy a he is is the better of her two parent even though she wa raised by her mother and she blame her motherunremarkability on her fatherdeparture and will do anything to keep her father back in her life and if morty need to risk his life traipsing across the galaxy with her insane alcoholic father itbetter than morty growing up in safety and ending up like her mother or her husband jerry who she considers to be unremarkable and unredemptive and therefore undeserving of her affection so the center of the show even though we don t address it at all is this really fucked up woman who i love more than any character on that show because she would have been a brain surgeon but she got pregnant at 17 and so shedefensive about how shea horse heart surgeon because it take le school to do that and sheselfish and shecold but shesmart she wear the pant in the family and shewitty and she doesn t like herself she bother to love her father and that keep everything feasible because otherwise it would all fall apart you d go why wouldn t anyone say stop doing that stop taking my son on these adventure the answer is because jerry is terrified that beth will leave him and beth is terrified that rick will leave her and round and round we go and so we have this beautiful suspension that could provide u with hundred of episode separation from jerry is a blessing and curse for her she ha been defining her life by her marriage straight out of high school to this unremarkable man that she in her mind compare to her mother while fetishising exceptionality in the form of her father that excuse being removed it just allows u to put the spotlight on beth a little bit and start asking a few more question about her

eyed woman from muskegon michigan in meeseeks and destroy at some point during her childhood her parent marriage deteriorated amid unknown circumstance and her father left her mother beth blamed herself for her parent falling out and seeing her father a an intelligent scientist compared to her mother beth came to idolize her father and blamed her mother for chasing off the dad with the gut to leave it is revealed in the abcof beth that at some point of her childhood beth became an insane and psychotic little girl she began to ask to her father rick to create toy like weapon to harm other child being an adult beth excused that she asked that to spend time with her father rick aware that the increasing danger that would represent his daughter created a dream world for his daughter froopyland in order to keep the other child of the neighborhood safe beth managed to take one of her friend tommy to froopyland where according to tommy she pushed the child into a honey swamp in an act of jealously with tommy and his good relationship with his father then she auto convinced herself that tommy got lost in froopyland beth aspired to become a heart surgeon a an adult but during high school when she wa already 17 year old she went to prom dance with her classmate jerry smith possibly out of pity or possibly out of manipulation of rick hoping to prompt the later conception of mortys beth and jerry had sex on prom night and she became impregnated with her first and only daughter summer she contemplated aborting the fetus later justifying that everybody think about it but managed to get into college and become a veterinary surgeon specializing in horse eventually finding work at st equis hospital she also decided to marry her boyfriend jerry and a few year later impregnated at the age of 20 year old had their second child and only son morty beth wa somewhat distant towards her child at their childhood a implied in raising gazorpazorp her job a a veterinary surgeon at st equis hospital cause her to spend le time with her husband and child feeling that coddling them would make them dependent or end up like her husband sometime after the abcof beth rick cloned her resulting in two beth it is unknown which beth is the original and which one is the clone though it ha been implied by dan harmon and the episode rick potion 9 and the whirly dirly conspiracy that jerry and bethrelationship wa more stable before rick came back into her life appearance beth is a slender woman with shoulder length blonde hair she wear a red collar shirt blue pant and white shoe a a little girl beth wore overall with a red shirt long white sock and black mary janes a well a a green hair clip and two different colored wristband personality beth is an intelligent ambitious and independent woman who suffers from a variety of deep seated insecurity a dedicated veterinary horse surgeon she is the familymain breadwinner and often try to do the best for her family based on this sense of responsibility she is highly insecure about her profession a a horse surgeon and is quick to snap at the implication she is not a real surgeon or a real veterinarian she may share this belief wishing she had been able to continue her medical education to become a real doctor in rixty minute nonetheless she is very dedicated to her job even beyond a a source of income and wa willing to give up her own pride to help successfully save a deerlife in a rickle in time although beth can sometimes be derisive of what she see a weakness dependence or emotional vulnerability she can still be compassionate and caring at time more so than her father when she and jerry accidentally hit a deer her first concern were to help and assist it and beth would stop at nothing to bring it back to health she often express grave concern for mortyeducation and health when they are not related to rick and is considerate of the consequence on her child of her leaving jerry she ha generally considered her family her first priority and ha defined her life around her marriage to jerry which ha at time driven her marital regret her dedication to her family can fade quickly if she feel patronized devalued or that she or another family member such a morty or rick is threatened beth ha a superiority complex believing herself at time to be above others a a way of hiding her insecurity she ha extended this behaviour to those such a her son morty particularly when he is shown taking care of his own son and her husband who unwittingly feed her insecurity by implying she wa not a real surgeon her genius fatherclear preference for her over her idiot husband ha in turn fed her feeling of superiority especially towards jerry she also exhibited resentment towards being patronized during her surgical work such a by her co worker davin when he let her know they re losing a patient or when another veterinarian implies she can not save a deer these feeling of superiority however seem to disappear quickly when rick is removed from her life or even when she merely feel more confident in herself a a result of her fatherdisappearance beth ha come to fixate on exceptionalism and intelligence and ha a fear of abandonment resulting in a deep seated desire to keep her father in her life a a result she is generally willing to put up with rick and his need without sarcasm or argument rationalizing his experiment and behavior she can become defensive and even insecure about this when challenged by it a in the wedding squanchers she call jerry a dumb asshole for proposing the idea that rick doesn t care for the family and so in turn they have no reason to treat him with care when meeting dr wong in pickle rick however she largely bragged about her father a a scientist and believed that the reason he turned himself into a pickle had nothing to do with the fact that he wanted to avoid family therapy which ended up being debunked a he did turn himself into a pickle to evade it however she ha some limit even for his behavior and ha given him ultimatum in pilot and auto erotic assimilation which he ha ultimately followed so she is not entirely defensive of her fatherbehaviors nevertheless the long lasting emotional scar embedded into beth by ricksudden abandonment left her to seek comfort in more reliable person such a jerry and to withhold confidence in herself her relationship jerry is extremely rocky beth and jerry have remained together partially due to the fact that jerry is the only man who ha not abandoned her she and jerry share a number of common goal generally around doing what is best for their family but these goal are strained by their disagreement on how to achieve these end she is often critical of his idea and suggests that she feel held back or unappreciated by him their disagreement over rickliving situation with them is an extremely frequent source of tension in many case jerry is often the more sentimental and nurturing one who call out rick for being a negative impact on morty and beth is often the one justifying his action beth ha notably inherited her fathertendency to rely on alcohol to control stress drinking wine briefly in meeseeks and destroy and amid more stressful situation very heavily in both rixty minute at the end of total rickall and in the rickshank rickdemption she also express excitement at the offer to go out for a drink with rick in pickle rick seeming to overlook both of her child a separate flashback in total rickall also show her suffering from a severe hangover causing her to whiplash a bottle at summer during her picture day giving her a black eye a a result in addition beth can be highly sarcastic at time such a when she predicted snuffle increased intelligence would backfire in the episode lawnmower dog in the season 3 episode the abcof beth an even further layer of bethpersonality wa revealed rick discloses that she had a tumultuous and destructive childhood only exacerbated by her murderous and sociopath tendency which rick accredits to his own mental state and whose behavior a a role model and eventual disappearance no doubt contributed to despite having acclimated towards a relatively normal life in adulthood this layer again reveals itself when she go to confront her childhood friend tommy and end the chaos ruling over her former imaginary paradise froopyland during the chaos she then realizes that while her childhood self idolized rick and wanted to be like him rick remains a deeply flawed individual and by some cruel twist of fate she turned out exactly like him needlessly destructive it is implied that the both of them deeply misunderstand the world a it appears to the majority who can easily adapt to it and live in accordance to a lifestyle set out for them through their own choice who know what they want and their life direction even if only for the fact that that they allow themselves to experience satisfaction happiness and completion instead of only sort of contempt towards an ordinary life in some misguided attempt to overcome it realizing that in divorcing jerry and coming to term with the way she is that there is no one and nothing holding her back from a living a life of self determination in accordance to her true broken identity rick proposes that beth resolve her identity issue through exploring the multiverse while an identical clone take her place for however long she is gone or even a lifetime it is not disclosed whether or not beth decides to remain it is likely that she chose the latter based on the scene that followed though the rickchurian mortydate put this into further debate the episode also revealed that beth wa very lonely a a little girl and may very well still be having asked rick to make her a whip that would make people like her and a sentient switchblade she wa also envious of her friend tommy and his father who wa present in his life which lead her to abandon him in froopyland mirroring her fatherimage and roused her to become a better person by her own standard overall beth is a complexly conflicted woman with several layer of contradictory nature firstly she envisions herself much like her morally bankrupt father rick admiring him for his unlimited intellect and independence which at first seems to stem from confidence of being virtually the smartest being in the universe however throughout the vast year of interstellar madness and chaos the universe ha to offer she realises rickcarelessness core origin lie in the awareness of how insignificant it all is his knowledge of the multiverse and endless alternate dimension with different version of everyone make him believe nothing matter and treat relationship and the human need for bond a pointless yet while beth is also intelligent enough to solve a complex issue and agree many time with her father she chooses to rather go with the ignorance and simpler curve in spite of her blood beth see life worth living even if it end up a nothing more than a tiny speck on the hourglass contradictory to her ideal version of herself a top surgeon and independent woman beth end up with the largest contrast to her own character and value jerry though facing serious marriage struggle like unintentional pregnancy from unprotected intercourse from the merger age of 17 a husband that for all his noble intention isn t especially smart and with misguided intention and sometimes serious issue urging divorce she ultimately find more comfort from jerry than she doe from rickrecognition for while rickattention and praise might boost her confidence and uncertainty greatly it is only temporary the love from a simple man such a her husband is so easy and pure in itself that she benefit more from it than seeking approval from her lonely drunk and careless father secondly bethlargest flaw is her insecure feeling of abandonment left by rick in her quest to reconnect with her long deserted father beth manages to destroy most of the good thing she had obtained without his presence a surprisingly adequate job given the circumstance from the high school pregnancy two child that she love and a unique marriage that despite all it difficulty provides comfort in season 3 she embrace a life without jerry and in the end she end up only stressed and uncertain when trying to re create the lost year between herself and rick by the end she embrace the fact that jerry is child like easily misguided insecure slightly belove avarege intelligence and somewhat pathetic and instead relish in being loved by man unconditionally like other faulty animated marriage like homer marge from the simpson beth think jerry is just a child that doe not know better admiring his effort to make up even if badly executed the origin of her reason to live with a man very much unlike herself could stem from her deep vulnerability when it come to being alone either way beth retains better trait and confidence from the man that never will leave her side than the mysterious father that really hold no interest in anyone besides himself for whatever the reason finally for all the bad thing beth inherit form her father alcoholism negligence unemotional attachment rude cold behaviour etc she manages to rise above the negative aspect which make rick rick while with keeping his strength intelligence bravery self reliance etc she start with a happy childhood until losing her mother and eventually her father which leaf her mingle alone for twenty year she is forced to grow up by herself and raise a family she wa unprepared for however it is her family that prof she succeeded even if it is a distorted vision of her future self her love is ultimately her greatest difference form her father and lack of knowledge or interest in treating thing a insignificant grant her more happiness than rick end up with relationship romance jerry beth met jerry in high school and had unprotected sex on prom night resulting in the pregnancy that produced their first and only daughter summer they become married since that incident eventually producing their second child and only son morty three year later their relationship is very rocky and strained due to the fact that both of them missed out on fulfilling their dream due to poor decision when they were teenager a when jerry put on a headset that allows him to view many reality in rixty minute he realizes that without beth he would have became a successful director beth often contemplates leaving jerry to pursue her own dream and happiness mentioning taking a trip or a break while jerry still love her and often try to keep their marriage together beth belief her father to be a better influence on their child than jerry which is another reason she think he should live with them jerry doesn t always seem to respect her occupation a horse surgeon and occasionally ha freudian slip about it which greatly offends her and she is often frustrated by jerryinsecurities and immature action ironically despite her continous frustration with jerry simple nature she herself also bear clear insecurity especially with her father due to her lonely childhood wether rick wa present or not beth doe have a vulnerability with abandonment this is one of the reason that beth married and stayed with jerry for more than 15 year because unlike rick he stay with her no matter what in spite of denial of rickclearly horrid character numerous evidence prof that jerry is right concerning bethfears of abandonment and definitely with her father being far from the ideal person or parent in rixty minute jerry and beth both get to see an alternate version of themselves in a different reality and find themselves unsatisfied with their current life leading them to eventually decide that splitting up would be inevitable however the alternate jerry and beth eventually realize that they are miserable without one another and get together after year apart seeing this renewed jerry and bethrelationship and they opted not to split up in the rickshank rickdemption jerry took a stand against rickbehavior towards the family apparent manipulation of bethfather issue in order to live rent free and his frequently putting their child in danger he told beth that it wa him or rick which led to the two deciding to divorce in the rickchurian mortydate beth visit her husband when she suffers from identity crisis and he reflects on a high school date they had and she end up kissing him a thanks they decide to get back together and hide from rick who still track them down but begrudgingly accepts their choice at the end they are living together again with both being happier and beth defended jerry from rickinsults during childrick of mort beth and jerry have problem but jerry save his wife from falling though beth refuse sex a gratitude when rick wa criticizing jerry beth for once doesn t defend her father and instead take her husbanddefense by voicing how she wa impressed with jerry because saved her life while criticizing rick this brings a smile to jerryface in season 5 beth and jerry appear more loving while openly claiming to watch pornography together thanks to dr wongtherapy and due to their new sexual nature they have a three way with mr nimbus family rick not much is known about the relationship of beth and her father rick prior to the event of the series jerry insinuates that beth wa raised like a reptile by rick suggesting that his method of parenting wa very unorthodox it is known that he left her mother for unknown reason beth is very happy that her father came back into her life sometime prior to pilot she is usually defensive of him when jerry badmouths him and is largely convinced that rick is good for the family when she came to realize that rick wa indeed a bad influence on morty and agreed with jerry to send him to a nursing home morty seemed to exhibit superhuman intelligence actually the result of dissolving mega seed further convincing her to keep him around beth affectionately celebrates the one year anniversary of rickreturn in close rick counter of the rick kind with ufo shaped pancake and despite her usual independence seems to dote on him and his alternate self in the same episode also multiple rick seem to like beth and compliment her for her kindness however this beth is not the same beth in rick potion 9 who come to the conclusion that her father rick is a selfish irresponsible as after he turned everyone on earth into monster and abandoned she jerry and summer in the season 2 finale the wedding squanchers beth get a closer look at her fatherpersonal life and try her best to keep jerry from ruining her chance of going on adventure with him more often later in the episode beth is heartbroken to find that rick abandoned her a second time little did she know that this time he turned himself in to protect her and her family from the federation when the family is taken back to earth by the galactic federation she burst into tear at the same time in the episode rickself sacrifice proved that he actually doe care about her beth also seems to enjoy rickinventions and appreciates the help he give her she allows rick to stay rent free in her home due to the fact that she doesn t want him leaving her again that is the same reason why she disagreed with jerry so strongly and wept when he suggested that the family turn in rick to the galactic federation so that they can go back home to earth in the wedding squanchers in the season 3 premiere the rickshank rickdemption when jerry finally give beth the ultimatum of choosing him or rick beth chooses rick leading to their divorce shortly after beth insists to rick that the divorce would be good for jerry and the family after he express remorse rick later admits to morty that he had a hand in manipulating this because jerry went against him in the whirly dirly conspiracy morty lash out on beth for her distance towards him and summer he blame this on her relationship with rick telling her that she doesn t need to prove herself to be worthy of ricklove by acting essentially just like him a it is making her appear just a narcissistic and irresponsible and that while shetrying to gain rickapproval shehurting him and summer beth believed she needed to prove herself to rick because of how rarely he ever tell her he love her he admits this to jaguar in pickle rick rick also admitted in the same episode to jerry that he belief jerry impregnating beth ruined her chance of being successful and detests him for his detachment to his daughter bethawareness of her mistreatment of her child may drive her farther away from rick a she will likely stop trying to get him to love her and instead find solace in her relationship with her child in the episode the abcof beth after beth and rick clone her childhood friend tommy and save his father from being executed they share a long awaited and progressive moment with each other beth discovers that all her life shebeen lying to herself that her father is a good man and tried desperately to be just like him she realizes that she doesn t want to be like him anymore and that she want to be herself rick finally tell her that he genuinely love her although in his own way and prof this to her by giving her an ultimatum he would clone her and let her leave to do what she want or she could stay and continue to care for the family it is likely that beth chose the latter option based on the scene that followed grazing her finger across the photo attached to the fridge beth smile at each picture a picture of mr poopybutthole her and jerry on their wedding day rick summer and lastly morty whose picture she rest her finger on the longest due to this suggestion in the rickchurian mortydate beth began to suffer from identity crisis despite rick constantly telling her she is real her spiral cause her to turn to jerry and reconcile with and hide from rick but he still find them forcing beth to confront him beth tell rick if she is a clone he should just kill her and get it over with or go to another dimension and be with another version of her however rick simply informs her she is his daughter and she is relieved though put off when he tell her he wa actually planning to kill jerry but relented in the end jerry move back in and rick begrudgingly accepts this while beth force him to watch his tone to her husband before she and the family laugh at rickexpense showing how much she moved from her fathershadow in star mort rickturn of the jerri after meeting clone beth and both of them dealing with rickconstant lie she loses a great amount of respect for him morty beth know that her son morty is not very intelligent and want him to succeed in school she ha no problem allowing rick to take morty on most adventure believing rick is not only teaching him valuable life skill and improving his intelligence but that he is the only friend morty ha she belief that morty wa filled with jerryinsecurities a a result of jerryoverly nurturing method of raising him and consequently she is largely absent from mortylife despite this beth doe seem to consistently care about mortywell being a she asks if morty is getting sick in pilot and is deeply concerned about the fact that he doe not do well in school or have any friend she wa even willing to sacrifice her relationship with rick so that morty could do better in school in the same episode in rick potion 9 beth c 137 admits that without her son morty and her father rick around she is much happier and seems indifferent to her sonfate it isn t unlikely that in the case that the same event were to occur in the dimension c 131 a they had in dimension c 137 that this beth would feel the same way however in the rickshank rickdemption that same beth along with her husband and daughter were going to kill the summer of the replacement dimension and keep morty meaning they missed him during their time apart in something ricked this way come beth communicates with morty through text reminding him of jerryintellectual insecurity so that he will accept jerryoffer to help him with his science project implying that they have a close relationship and have a mutual understanding for each other and jerry apart from this their relationship ha yet to be explored in any other significant detail in the series that is until the whirly dirly conspiracy in the whirly dirly conspiracy morty lash out on beth for her distance towards him and summer he blame this on her relationship with rick telling her that she doesn t need to prove herself to be worthy of ricklove by acting essentially just like him a it is making her appear just a narcissistic and irresponsible and that while shetrying to gain rickapproval shehurting him and summer upon realizing this beth institute change and later us the morphizer to make herself giant put her skin inside out and comfort summer who wa cry and really needed her at the moment bethawareness of her mistreatment of her child ha initiated a change in her making her more motherly and understanding this change will likely bring her closer to morty a well a summer but farther from rick in mortymind blower it wa revealed that beth prefers her daughter summer over her son morty beth wa trapped in a situation where an evil alien from another dimension wa planning on killing one of her two child and graced her with the choice of which one life without any hesitation beth immediately demanded that her daughter summer be the one who survives morty wa shocked at his motherchoice a wa the alien but luckily rick rescued his daughter and grandchild and erased her sonmemories though he recalled this but forgot again the reason of bethchoice is because she is jealous of his closer relationship with rick however it is apparent beth still love her son due to her behavior in the rickchurian mortydate where she wa happy to be a family again it is also likely that without her father rickinfluence morty could be bethfavorite in season 1 of the series before rickimpact on the family cemented beth consistently showed concern for her son mortyhealth and well being and in the episode the abcof beth after talking with her father about his offer to create a clone of her beth still contemplating carry her hand carefully over all the individual picture of the family on the refrigerator this ended at her sonpicture who she looked at the longest and smiled at afterwards this could mean that beth doe indeed love her son morty during a rickconvenient mort beth ultimately show she doe love morty by voicing disapproval of his status with planetina because of the age gap despite her being unaging and his recklessness in getting involved with her morty became angry with beth after she demand planetina leave morty subsequently lashed out at her by voicing his adventure and how beth a well a the rest of the family doubt him and never let him be happy leaving beth stunned and somewhat guilty when morty and planetina break up beth overhearing the argument comfort a weeping morty summer beth love and care about her daughter summer but the two do not seem very close much of the time beth had originally planned to get aborted the girl when she wa still a

homeless manbeth after rick tell her shenot a clone behind the scene dan harmon ha frequently offered insight into bethcharacterisation since early around the release of the first season observing that it is beth whose behavior enables rick to be able to take morty on their adventure oh my god beth is so messed up i guess i know more about her than what you ve learned so far but you know she got pregnant at seventeen you know the guy that knocked her up wouldn t have been her first choice you know her motherout of the picture but that her dad who wa out of the picture when she wa a child is now back in the picture and that unlike jerry she seems relatively fine with his influence on her learning disabled son it seems like she d rather her son risk his life with her insane father than end up being like her husband thatreally really fucked up we know that kid blame themselves for their parent breaking up thatpretty standard psychology but from there we have different mechanism for coping with the blame and one of the strategy we see people employ in the face of an absentee parent is a deification of the parent that take le responsibility beth think her dad is better than her mother because her dad had the brain and gut to leave her thatreally really fucked up rickdaughter is more fucked up than rick and fucked up because of rick don t you worry about that i wa like why would that be the case why would any parent let this crazy man disappear through clearly dangerous portal with their son and after talking about it with justin for a while i realized the most important thing about that show for me which is that rick left at one point in bethchildhood and beth blamed her mother for rickabsence kid can sometimes idolize their worst parent and blame their supportive parent for chasing off the dad with the gut to leave sometimes they don t even admit it to themselves but they say my dadso fucking cool he got the fuck out of here and my momsuch a bitch shealways asking me to clean my room thatwhy dad left she probably asked him to clean his room and in bethcase shea horse heart surgeon shenot a real surgeon shea horse heart surgeon because she got pregnant at 17 and she fetishizes exceptionality she belief that rick a crazy a he is is the better of her two parent even though she wa raised by her mother and she blame her motherunremarkability on her fatherdeparture and will do anything to keep her father back in her life and if morty need to risk his life traipsing across the galaxy with her insane alcoholic father itbetter than morty growing up in safety and ending up like her mother or her husband jerry who she considers to be unremarkable and unredemptive and therefore undeserving of her affection so the center of the show even though we don t address it at all is this really fucked up woman who i love more than any character on that show because she would have been a brain surgeon but she got pregnant at 17 and so shedefensive about how shea horse heart surgeon because it take le school to do that and sheselfish and shecold but shesmart she wear the pant in the family and shewitty and she doesn t like herself she bother to love her father and that keep everything feasible because otherwise it would all fall apart you d go why wouldn t anyone say stop doing that stop taking my son on these adventure the answer is because jerry is terrified that beth will leave him and beth is terrified that rick will leave her and round and round we go and so we have this beautiful suspension that could provide u with hundred of episode separation from jerry is a blessing and curse for her she ha been defining her life by her marriage straight out of high school to this unremarkable man that she in her mind compare to her mother while fetishising exceptionality in the form of her father that excuse being removed it just allows u to put the spotlight on beth a little bit and start asking a few more question about her

stable before rick came back into her life in the episode rick potion 9 rick gave morty a love potion that went wildly out of hand due to rick failing to mention a side effect the love potion wa infected with the flu and it spread like a virus around the school causing everyone to mutate into praying mantis like creature and later on into cronenbergs this went on to infect the entire world and make the entire human race like this the love potion didn t work on people who are genetically related to it user meaning that the smith family including beth were unaffected by this during the

relatively attractive woman with shoulder length blonde hair she wear a red collar shirt blue pant and white shoe underneath her shirt beth actually ha rather large breast which even summer point out she also admits that her waist have gotten bigger following rick potion 9 beth is shown in the rickshank rickdemption to have descended into a dishevelled appearance now wearing black boot and the peach colored remains of a cronenberg over her original red shirt a well a blue pant ripped into short in addition to this she also ha a more toned and muscular appearance and longer darker hair with green stain mixed in personality beth is an intelligent ambitious and independent woman who suffers from a variety of deep seated insecurity a dedicated veterinary horse surgeon she is the familymain breadwinner and often try to do the best for her family based on this sense of responsibility she is insecure about her profession however and is quick to snap at the implication she is not a real surgeon or a real veterinarian since she generally is a horse surgeon she can be very compassionate and caring to those around her more openly so than her father or husband she express grave concern multiple time for mortyeducation and health and despite her marital regret she often considers the consequence of leaving jerry she generally ha considered her family to be her first priority however this quality can fade out quickly if she feel patronized devalued or that she or another family member such a morty or rick is threatened while both she and jerry share a number of common goal generally around doing what is best for their family these goal are strained by their disagreement on how to achieve these end beth is quite critical of jerryideas and often display sarcasm such a when she predicted snuffle increased intelligence would backfire she also feel under appreciated by jerry at time or that their relationship is tying her down their disagreement over rickliving situation with them is an extremely frequent source of tension while in many case including with their son jerry is often the more sentimental and nurturing one when the issue come to rick she is often the one justifying his action a recurring theme in their relationship is beth desiring to take a break or even a trip from jerry who unwittingly feed her insecurity by implying she is not a real surgeon while her father seems to value her highly over her idiot husband in turn feeding her feeling of superiority she also highly resents being patronised by her co worker devin when he let her know they re losing a patient constantly these feeling of superiority however seem to disappear when rick is removed from her life or even when she merely feel more confident in herself beth ha a fervent desire to keep her father in her life stemming from the fact that he wa absent from her life for twenty year after he left her and her mother for unknown reason a a result she ha abandonment issue and deeply wish to keep him in her life it is one of the reason her relationship with jerry is so strained she mock him because it give her rick approval she is generally willing to put up with rick and his need without sarcasm or argument though she ha her limit even for his behavior and ha given him ultimatum in pilot which he ha followed she seems to have also inherited her fatheralcoholism and is seen drinking wine briefly in meeseeks and destroy however she doe overcome this in rick potion 9 where she come to realize that jerry truly doe love her and will never leave her a rick did and so her view of rick drop to how jerry view him a of the rickshank rickdemption she and her husband and daughter have gone somewhat insane a they have chosen to devour the cronenbergs and by their desire to kill summer because she stunk of rick however a part of their original self seem to remain a they attempted to keep their original morty back meaning they may have missed him after getting used to living in a post apocalyptic world she became more a brave cruel sadistic and wild woman it is implied she may have lost some level of her mentality a she smile when jerry destroys the portal gun and appears to want to drive off or possibly kill the summer from the replacement dimension relationship rick not much is known about the relationship of beth and her father rick prior to the event of the series jerry insinuates that beth wa raised like a reptile by rick suggesting that his method of parenting wa very unorthodox her father wa the rick known a rick prime who after inventing the portal gun abandoned his wife and daughter forever to live like a god when rick from dimension c 137 came into her life sometime prior to pilot she wa very happy that her father had come back she had conflicting feeling about rick due to falsely believing that this relatively more compassionate rick and the rick who abandoned her were one and the same but despite unspoken resentment she belief him to be stronger than her mother because he had the strength to leave she is usually defensive of him when jerry badmouths him and is largely convinced that rick is good for the family when she came to realize that rick wa indeed a bad influence on morty and agreed with jerry to send him to a nursing home morty seemed to exhibit superhuman intelligence actually the result of dissolving megaseeds convincing her to keep him around however in rick potion no 9 she come to the conclusion that her father rick is a selfish and irresponsible as in the rickshank rickdemption she and her husband and daughter voiced their deep hatred of rick for what he ha done to their world morty beth know that her son morty is not very intelligent and want him to succeed in school she ha no problem allowing rick to take morty on most adventure believing rick is not only teaching him valuable life skill and improving his intelligence but that he is the only friend morty

consistently care about mortywell being a she asks if morty is getting sick in pilot and is concerned about the fact that he doe not do well in school or have any friend their relationship ha yet to explored in any detail in the series however in rick potion no 9 she admits that without her son morty and her father rick around she is much happier and seems indifferent to her sonfate however in the rickshank rickdemption she and her husband and daughter attempt to keep morty from leaving their world meaning they possibly missed him in their time apart jerry beth met her future husband jerry in the high school and had unprotected sex on prom night resulting in the pregnancy that produced their first and only daughter summer and seem to have been together and married ever since their second and only son morty wa born three year later their relationship is very rocky and strained due to the fact that both of them missed out on fulfilling their dream due to poor decision making when they were teenager jerry seems to still love beth quite a lot and try hard to keep their marriage together but beth more than often contemplates leaving jerry to pursue her own happiness and dream beth is angered by the fact that jerry doe not consider her job a a horse surgeon a being a real surgeon and is often frustrated by jerryinsecurities and immature action she describes loving jerry a

and abandoned it he regularly go to other dimension to harvest resource and will often willingly kill alien to get them he is willing to be extremely brutal such a when people betray him or his life or those close to him are in danger he is usually portrayed a homicidal and having a large disregard for life enough that he came close to bombing the world with neutrino while drunk he wa shown to find killing fun during the purge and wa even willing to kill mortyhalf gazorpian son due to the childdanger to everyone and unstable nature this doe not make him completely heartless however a he ha

done enough killing and began to find it gratuitous in the past rick wa a hero like space beth but eventually stopped deeming it a phase contrary to popular belief rick is not a nihilist although his commonly stated viewpoint on life may be the typical nihilistic idealism that nothing ha meaning he doesn t always put his money where his mouth is rick express love and emotion for his family and lover on an almost episodic basis plot relevant instance include the abcof beth which prof his fatherly love for beth and auto erotic assimilation where hebeing dumped by unity made him depressed enough to cry rick frequently reminds people that heabove everything that could hold meaning or value to him and made i don t give a fuck his new catchphrase in ricksy business but this is all a mask rick is shown to care about maintaining relationship with others and hold a sentimental value of his family rick ha the tendency to be possessive and dominating of morty believing the boy to be his own personal helper this doesn t prevent rick from genuinely caring about morty he occasionally us his own invention to improve his grandsonlife such a invading the dream of mr goldenfold to help raise his math grade though this could have been a tactic for morty to skip more school to go on adventure with rick rick also demonstrates being fairly protective of morty a shown in the episode meeseeks and destroy where he eventually set aside his cynicism to allow morty to have a positive adventure and abruptly kill mr jellybean a the two are leaving the fantasy world because of the previous attempted rape on morty he even tried to sacrifice himself for morty in a rickle in time and accepted death that is until he saw a way out of dying he cried when seeing picture of morty and remembering morty a a newborn reaching out to him when he wa held captive by evil rick causing evil rick to mock him for his irrational attachment for morty nonetheless to his core ricklove or at least apathy for morty only go so far a he can throw him under the carpet the numerous adventure where he constantly hurt and abuse morty verbally undermines his achievement physically bully him force him to make unethical and traumatising action and completely break down his confidence and self worth have pushed morty to several breaking point in the rickshank rickdemption morty shoot rick after being berated by his grandfather and sister a a screw up though that wa rickplan however unbeknownst to him wa that morty had the intention to kill and did not know the gun had a fake shot by season 5 rick acknowledges how unhealthy his relationship with his grandson is and replaces him in forgetting sarick mortshall with two crow it started a a exaggerated joke to once again take morty down a peg but he claim that the fact the two bird prove a useful on adventure a morty rick state that in actuality mortyworth is no more than his new sidekick however rick doe reunite with morty in the last episode when he discovers he served a the crow rebound not the other way around ironically this gave him a brief moment of the insignificance he make morty feel in comparison to him rick and morty have a strong bond even though their relationship is strained due to rickcynicism alcoholism lack of conventional morality and his tendency to push aside other member of the smith family rickcarelessness is prevalent around jerry a he clearly doesn t respect him in any sense and his relationship with beth can be tumultuous at time in raising gazorpazorp and something ricked this way come summer tag along on some of rickadventures rick initially had very little interest in her but over time a the two spent time together they have begun to develop a closer bond rick is shown to have trouble taking order from others he is anti totalitarian a a result rick tends to dislike people with authority and government official he refuse to join the council of rick because he view them a a government he also call the guard at intergalactic custom robot and claim that he doesn t respect them a he deems them bureaucrat and doesn t like being told where to go and what to do rick also ha a great dislike of standardized education claiming that school isn t a place for smart people and a waste of time and insists that thing such a studying and homework are pointless and stupid rick claim to be atheistic but hold seemingly contradictory belief on religion at one point he tell summer at the breakfast table in the pilot there is no god yet in the anatomy park episode he tell the family do you realize that christ wa born today jesus christ our savior wa born today are you people even human what kind of christmas is this this comment wa most likely sarcastic he also quickly recognizes mr needful a the devil and when heunder the impression that he is going to die while one of the other sixty three rick is chasing after mortylost collar actually kneel and prays please god if therea hell please be merciful to me significantly when no one is around however when the 1 64th rick succeeds he retracts his statement yell fuck you god not today bitch so this allusion to religion may have just been a sarcastic comment when the rick recombine in the presence of summer and morty he once again say i did it there is no god in your face itpossible this is just due to rickego and his complete confidence in his own ability rick is most likely just atheistic making religious joke and reference a in never ricking morty it is revealed that the most uncharacteristic act rick would do is resort and pray to jesus christ a it crash the entire story train despite his general disregard for others he is shown to harbor deep emotional pain and sorrow especially when it come to his romantic relationship such a with his former wife diane and unity in rickmurai jack itrevealed that rick loved diane dearly her death left a permanent mark on rick leading him to go on a decade

parent falling out and seeing her father a an intelligent scientist compared to her mother beth came to idolize her father and blamed her mother for chasing off the dad with the gut to leave it is revealed in the abcof beth that at some point of her childhood beth became an insane and psychotic little girl she began to ask to her father rick to create toy like weapon to harm other child being an adult beth excused that she asked that to spend time with her father rick aware that the increasing danger that would represent his daughter created a dream world for his daughter froopyland in order to keep the other child of the neighborhood safe beth managed to take one of her friend tommy to froopyland where according to tommy she pushed the child into a honey swamp in an act of jealously with tommy and his good relationship with his father then she auto convinced herself that tommy got lost in froopyland beth aspired to become a heart surgeon a an adult but during high school when she wa already 17 year old she went to prom dance with her classmate jerry smith possibly out of pity or possibly out of manipulation of rick hoping to prompt the later conception of mortys beth and jerry had sex on prom night and she became impregnated with her first and only daughter summer she contemplated aborting the fetus later justifying that everybody think about it but managed to get into college and become a veterinary surgeon specializing in horse eventually finding work at st equis hospital she also decided to marry her boyfriend jerry and a few year later

surgeon at st equis hospital cause her to spend le time with her husband and child feeling that coddling them would make them dependent or end up like her husband sometime after the abcof beth rick cloned her resulting in two beth it is unknown which beth is the original and which one is the clone though it ha been implied by dan harmon and the episode rick potion 9 and the whirly dirly conspiracy that jerry and bethrelationship wa more stable before rick came back into her life appearance beth is a slender woman with shoulder length blonde hair she wear a red collar shirt blue pant and white shoe a a little girl beth wore overall with a red shirt long white sock and black mary janes a well a a green hair clip and two different colored wristband personality beth is an intelligent ambitious and independent woman who suffers from a variety of deep seated insecurity a dedicated veterinary horse surgeon she is the familymain breadwinner and often try to do the best for her family based on this sense of responsibility she is highly insecure about her profession a a horse surgeon and is quick to snap at the implication she is not a real surgeon or a real veterinarian she may share this belief wishing she had been able to continue her medical education to become a real doctor in rixty minute nonetheless she is very dedicated to her job even beyond a a source of income and wa willing to give up her own pride to help successfully save a deerlife in a rickle in time although beth can sometimes be derisive of what she see a weakness dependence or emotional vulnerability she can still be compassionate and caring at time more so than her father when she and jerry accidentally hit a deer her first concern were to help and assist it and beth would stop at nothing to bring it back to health she often express grave concern for mortyeducation and health when they are not related to rick and is considerate of the consequence on her child of her leaving jerry she ha generally considered her family her first priority and ha defined her life around her marriage to jerry which ha at time driven her marital regret her dedication to her family can fade quickly if she feel patronized devalued or that she or another family member such a morty or rick is threatened beth ha a superiority complex believing herself at time to be above others a a way of hiding her insecurity she ha extended this behaviour to those such a her son morty particularly when he is shown taking care of his own son and her husband who unwittingly feed her insecurity by implying she wa not a real surgeon her genius fatherclear preference for her over her idiot husband ha in turn fed her feeling of superiority especially towards jerry she also exhibited resentment towards being patronized during her surgical work such a by her co worker davin when he let her know they re losing a patient or when another veterinarian implies she can not save a deer these feeling of superiority however seem to disappear quickly when rick is removed from her life or even when she merely feel more confident in herself a a result of her fatherdisappearance beth ha come to fixate on exceptionalism and intelligence and ha a fear of abandonment resulting in a deep seated desire to keep her father in her life a a result she is generally willing to put up with rick and his need without sarcasm or argument rationalizing his experiment and behavior she can become defensive and even insecure about this when challenged by it a in the wedding squanchers she call jerry a dumb asshole for proposing the idea that rick doesn t care for the family and so in turn they have no reason to treat him with care when meeting dr wong in pickle rick however she largely bragged about her father a a scientist and believed that the reason he turned himself into a pickle had nothing to do with the fact that he wanted to avoid family therapy which ended up being debunked a he did turn himself into a pickle to evade it however she ha some limit even for his behavior and ha given him ultimatum in pilot and auto erotic assimilation which he ha ultimately followed so she is not entirely defensive of her fatherbehaviors nevertheless the long lasting emotional scar embedded into beth by ricksudden abandonment left her to seek comfort in more reliable person such a jerry and to withhold confidence in herself her relationship jerry is extremely rocky beth and jerry have remained together partially due to the fact that jerry is the only man who ha not abandoned her she and jerry share a number of common goal generally around doing what is best for their family but these goal are strained by their disagreement on how to achieve these end she is often critical of his idea and suggests that she feel held back or unappreciated by him their disagreement over rickliving situation with them is an extremely frequent source of tension in many case jerry is often the more sentimental and nurturing one who call out rick for being a negative impact on morty and beth is often the one justifying his action beth ha notably inherited her fathertendency to rely on alcohol to control stress drinking wine briefly in meeseeks and destroy and amid more stressful situation very heavily in both rixty minute at the end of total rickall and in the rickshank rickdemption she also express excitement at the offer to go out for a drink with rick in pickle rick seeming to overlook both of her child a separate flashback in total rickall also show her suffering from a severe hangover causing her to whiplash a bottle at summer during her picture day giving her a black eye a a result in addition beth can be highly sarcastic at time such a when she predicted snuffle increased intelligence would backfire in the episode lawnmower dog in the season 3 episode the abcof beth an even further layer of bethpersonality wa revealed rick discloses that she had a tumultuous and destructive childhood only exacerbated by her murderous and sociopath tendency which rick accredits to his own mental state and whose behavior a a role model and eventual disappearance no doubt contributed to despite having acclimated towards a relatively normal life in adulthood this layer again reveals itself when she go to confront her childhood friend tommy and end the chaos ruling over her former imaginary paradise froopyland during the chaos she then realizes that while her childhood self idolized rick and wanted to be like him rick remains a deeply flawed individual and by some cruel twist of fate she turned out exactly like him needlessly destructive it is implied that the both of them deeply misunderstand the world a it appears to the majority who can easily adapt to it and live in accordance to a lifestyle set out for them through their own choice who know what they want and their life direction even if only for the fact that that they allow themselves to experience satisfaction happiness and completion instead of only sort of contempt towards an ordinary life in some misguided attempt to overcome it realizing that in divorcing jerry and coming to term with the way she is that there is no one and nothing holding her back from a living a life of self determination in accordance to her true broken identity rick proposes that beth resolve her identity issue through exploring the multiverse while an identical clone take her place for however long she is gone or even a lifetime it is not disclosed whether or not beth decides to remain it is likely that she chose the latter based on the scene that followed though the rickchurian mortydate put this into further debate the episode also revealed that beth wa very lonely a a little girl and may very well still be having asked rick to make her a whip that would make people like her and a sentient switchblade she wa also envious of her friend tommy and his father who wa present in his life which lead her to abandon him in froopyland mirroring her fatherimage and roused her to become a better person by her own standard overall beth is a complexly conflicted woman with several layer of contradictory nature firstly she envisions herself much like her morally bankrupt father rick admiring him for his unlimited intellect and independence which at first seems to stem from confidence of being virtually the smartest being in the universe however throughout the vast year of interstellar madness and chaos the universe ha to offer she realises rickcarelessness core origin lie in the awareness of how insignificant it all is his knowledge of the multiverse and endless alternate dimension with different version of everyone make him believe nothing matter and treat relationship and the human need for bond a pointless yet while beth is also intelligent enough to solve a complex issue and agree many time with her father she chooses to rather go with the ignorance and simpler curve in spite of her blood beth see life worth living even if it end up a nothing more than a tiny speck on the hourglass contradictory to her ideal version of herself a top surgeon and independent woman beth end up with the largest contrast to her own character and value jerry though facing serious marriage struggle like unintentional pregnancy from unprotected intercourse from the merger age of 17 a husband that for all his noble intention isn t especially smart and with misguided intention and sometimes serious issue urging divorce she ultimately find more comfort from jerry than she doe from rickrecognition for while rickattention and praise might boost her confidence and uncertainty greatly it is only temporary the love from a simple man such a her husband is so easy and pure in itself that she benefit more from it than seeking approval from her lonely drunk and careless father secondly bethlargest flaw is her insecure feeling of abandonment left by rick in her quest to reconnect with her long deserted father beth manages to destroy most of the good thing she had obtained without his presence a surprisingly adequate job given the circumstance from the high school pregnancy two child that she love and a unique marriage that despite all it difficulty provides comfort in season 3 she embrace a life without jerry and in the end she end up only stressed and uncertain when trying to re create the lost year between herself and rick by the end she embrace the fact that jerry is child like easily misguided insecure slightly belove avarege intelligence and somewhat pathetic and instead relish in being loved by man unconditionally like other faulty animated marriage like homer marge from the simpson beth think jerry is just a child that doe not know better admiring his effort to make up even if badly executed the origin of her reason to live with a man very much unlike herself could stem from her deep vulnerability when it come to being alone either way beth retains better trait and confidence from the man that never will leave her side than the mysterious father that really hold no interest in anyone besides himself for whatever the reason finally for all the bad thing beth inherit form her father alcoholism negligence unemotional attachment rude cold behaviour etc she manages to rise above the negative aspect which make rick rick while with keeping his strength intelligence bravery self reliance etc she start with a happy childhood until losing her mother and eventually her father which leaf her mingle alone for twenty year she is forced to grow up by herself and raise a family she wa unprepared for however it is her family that prof she succeeded even if it is a distorted vision of her future self her love is ultimately her greatest difference form her father and lack of knowledge or interest in treating thing a insignificant grant her more happiness than rick end up with relationship romance jerry beth met jerry in high school and had unprotected sex on prom night resulting in the pregnancy that produced their first and only daughter summer they become married since that incident eventually producing their second child and only son morty three year later their relationship is very rocky and strained due to the fact that both of them missed out on fulfilling their dream due to poor decision when they were teenager a when jerry put on a headset that allows him to view many reality in rixty minute he realizes that without beth he would have became a successful director beth often contemplates leaving jerry to pursue her own dream and happiness mentioning taking a trip or a break while jerry still love her and often try to keep their marriage together beth belief her father to be a better influence on their child than jerry which is another reason she think he should live with them jerry doesn t always seem to respect her occupation a horse surgeon and occasionally ha freudian slip about it which greatly offends her and she is often frustrated by jerryinsecurities and immature action ironically despite her continous frustration with jerry simple nature she herself also bear clear insecurity especially with her father due to her lonely childhood wether rick wa present or not beth doe have a vulnerability with abandonment this is one of the reason that beth married and stayed with jerry for more than 15 year because unlike rick he stay with her no matter what in spite of denial of rickclearly horrid character numerous evidence prof that jerry is right concerning bethfears of abandonment and definitely with her father being far from the ideal person or parent in rixty minute jerry and beth both get to see an alternate version of themselves in a different reality and find themselves unsatisfied with their current life leading them to eventually decide that splitting up would be inevitable however the alternate jerry and beth eventually realize that they are miserable without one another and get together after year apart seeing this renewed jerry and bethrelationship and they opted not to split up in the rickshank rickdemption jerry took a stand against rickbehavior towards the family apparent manipulation of bethfather issue in order to live rent free and his frequently putting their child in danger he told beth that it wa him or rick which led to the two deciding to divorce in the rickchurian mortydate beth visit her husband when she suffers from identity crisis and he reflects on a high school date they had and she end up kissing him a thanks they decide to get back together and hide from rick who still track them down but begrudgingly accepts their choice at the end they are living together again with both being happier and beth defended jerry from rickinsults during childrick of mort beth and jerry have problem but jerry save his wife from falling though beth refuse sex a gratitude when rick wa criticizing jerry beth for once doesn t defend her father and instead take her husbanddefense by voicing how she wa impressed with jerry because saved her life while criticizing rick this brings a smile to jerryface in season 5 beth and jerry appear more loving while openly claiming to watch pornography together thanks to dr wongtherapy and due to their new sexual nature they have a three way with mr nimbus family rick not much is known about the relationship of beth and her father rick prior to the event of the series jerry insinuates that beth wa raised like a reptile by rick suggesting that his method of parenting wa very unorthodox it is known that he left her mother for unknown reason beth is very happy that her father came back into her life sometime prior to pilot she is usually defensive of him when jerry badmouths him and is largely convinced that rick is good for the family when she came to realize that rick wa indeed a bad influence on morty and agreed with jerry to send him to a nursing home morty seemed to exhibit superhuman intelligence actually the result of dissolving mega seed further convincing her to keep him around beth affectionately celebrates the one year anniversary of rickreturn in close rick counter of the rick kind with ufo shaped pancake and despite her usual independence seems to dote on him and his alternate self in the same episode also multiple rick seem to like beth and compliment her for her kindness however this beth is not the same beth in rick potion 9 who come to the conclusion that her father rick is a selfish irresponsible as after he turned everyone on earth into monster and abandoned she jerry and summer in the season 2 finale the wedding squanchers beth get a closer look at her fatherpersonal life and try her best to keep jerry from ruining her chance of going on adventure with him more often later in the episode beth is heartbroken to find that rick abandoned her a second time little did she know that this time he turned himself in to protect her and her family from the federation when the family is taken back to earth by the galactic federation she burst into tear at the same time in the episode rickself sacrifice proved that he actually doe care about her beth also seems to enjoy rickinventions and appreciates the help he give her she allows rick to stay rent free in her home due to the fact that she doesn t want him leaving her again that is the same reason why she disagreed with jerry so strongly and wept when he suggested that the family turn in rick to the galactic federation so that they can go back home to earth in the wedding squanchers in the season 3 premiere the rickshank rickdemption when jerry finally give beth the ultimatum of choosing him or rick beth chooses rick leading to their divorce shortly after beth insists to rick that the divorce would be good for jerry and the family after he express remorse rick later admits to morty that he had a hand in manipulating this because jerry went against him in the whirly dirly conspiracy morty lash out on beth for her distance towards him and summer he blame this on her relationship with rick telling her that she doesn t need to prove herself to be worthy of ricklove by acting essentially just like him a it is making her appear just a narcissistic and irresponsible and that while shetrying to gain rickapproval shehurting him and summer beth believed she needed to prove herself to rick because of how rarely he ever tell her he love her he admits this to jaguar in pickle rick rick also admitted in the same episode to jerry that he belief jerry impregnating beth ruined her chance of being successful and detests him for his detachment to his daughter bethawareness of her mistreatment of her child may drive her farther away from rick a she will likely stop trying to get him to love her and instead find solace in her relationship with her child in the episode the abcof beth after beth and rick clone her childhood friend tommy and save his father from being executed they share a long awaited and progressive moment with each other beth discovers that all her life shebeen lying to herself that her father is a good man and tried desperately to be just like him she realizes that she doesn t want to be like him anymore and that she want to be herself rick finally tell her that he genuinely love her although in his own way and prof this to her by giving her an ultimatum he would clone her and let her leave to do what she want or she could stay and continue to care for the family it is likely that beth chose the latter option based on the scene that followed grazing her finger across the photo attached to the fridge beth smile at each picture a picture of mr poopybutthole her and jerry on their wedding day rick summer and lastly morty whose picture she rest her finger on the longest due to this suggestion in the rickchurian mortydate beth began to suffer from identity crisis despite rick constantly telling her she is real her spiral cause her to turn to jerry and reconcile with and hide from rick but he still find them forcing beth to confront him beth tell rick if she is a clone he should just kill her and get it over with or go to another dimension and be with another version of her however rick simply informs her she is his daughter and she is relieved though put off when he tell her he wa actually planning to kill jerry but relented in the end jerry move back in and rick begrudgingly accepts this while beth force him to watch his tone to her husband before she and the family laugh at rickexpense showing how much she moved from her fathershadow in star mort rickturn of the jerri after meeting clone beth and both of them dealing with rickconstant lie she loses a great amount of respect for him morty beth know that her son morty is not very intelligent and want him to succeed in school she ha no problem allowing rick to take morty on most adventure believing rick is not only teaching him valuable life skill and improving his intelligence but that he is the only friend morty ha she belief that morty wa filled with jerryinsecurities a a result of jerryoverly nurturing method of raising him and consequently she is largely absent from mortylife despite this beth doe seem to consistently care about mortywell being a she asks if morty is getting sick in pilot and is deeply concerned about the fact that he doe not do well in school or have any friend she wa even willing to sacrifice her relationship with rick so that morty could do better in school in the same episode in rick potion 9 beth c 137 admits that without her son morty and her father rick around she is much happier and seems indifferent to her sonfate it isn t unlikely that in the case that the same event were to occur in the dimension c 131 a they had in dimension c 137 that this beth would feel the same way however in the rickshank rickdemption that same beth along with her husband and daughter were going to kill the summer of the replacement dimension and keep morty meaning they missed him during their time apart in something ricked this way come beth communicates with morty through text reminding him of jerryintellectual insecurity so that he will accept jerryoffer to help him with his science project implying that they have a close relationship and have a mutual understanding for each other and jerry apart from this their relationship ha yet to be explored in any other significant detail in the series that is until the whirly dirly conspiracy in the whirly dirly conspiracy morty lash out on beth for her distance towards him and summer he blame this on her relationship with rick telling her that she doesn t need to prove herself to be worthy of ricklove by acting essentially just like him a it is making her appear just a narcissistic and irresponsible and that while shetrying to gain rickapproval shehurting him and summer upon realizing this beth institute change and later us the morphizer to make herself giant put her skin inside out and comfort summer who wa cry and really needed her at the moment bethawareness of her mistreatment of her child ha initiated a change in her making her more motherly and understanding this change will likely bring her closer to morty a well a summer but farther from rick in mortymind blower it wa revealed that beth prefers her daughter summer over her son morty beth wa trapped in a situation where an evil alien from another dimension wa planning on killing one of her two child and graced her with the choice of which one life without any hesitation beth immediately demanded that her daughter summer be the one who survives morty wa shocked at his motherchoice a wa the alien but luckily rick rescued his daughter and grandchild and erased her sonmemories though he recalled this but forgot again the reason of bethchoice is because she is jealous of his closer relationship with rick however it is apparent beth still love her son due to her behavior in the rickchurian mortydate where she wa happy to be a family again it is also likely that without her father rickinfluence morty could be bethfavorite in season 1 of the series before rickimpact on the family cemented beth consistently showed concern for her son mortyhealth and well being and in the episode the abcof beth after talking with her father about his offer to create a clone of her beth still contemplating carry her hand carefully over all the individual picture of the family on the refrigerator this ended at her sonpicture who she looked at the longest and smiled at afterwards this could mean that beth doe indeed love her son morty during a rickconvenient mort beth ultimately show she doe love morty by voicing disapproval of his status with planetina because of the age gap despite her being unaging and his recklessness in getting involved with her morty became angry with beth after she demand planetina leave morty subsequently lashed out at her by voicing his adventure and how beth a well a the rest of the family doubt him and never let him be happy leaving beth stunned and somewhat guilty when morty and planetina break up beth overhearing the argument

may not be permanent a she hasn t been a motherly or supportive in any other episode especially not to summer who along with morty need this the most from her in mortymind blower it wa revealed that beth prefer her daughter summer over her son morty beth wa trapped in a situation where an evil alien from another dimension wa planning on killing one of her two child and graced her with the choice of which one life without any hesitation beth immediately demanded that her daughter summer be the one who survives her preference for her only daughter over her only son could be because she is jealous of his close relationship with rick this may also be due to the fact the in rixty minute summer learned she wa an unplanned pregnancy after finding very few alternate version of herself while it ha been stated many time that there are multiple mortys in other timeline and beth wanted to spare her only daughter space beth space beth is either bethclone or the original beth that this beth wa

appears to be aware that the family is in a tv show quoting at the end of the rickchurian mortydate that the family will be back to the way it wa in season 1 when she and her husband jerry get back together in the rickshank rickdemption rick created a memory of bethmother diane however this depiction wa of diane from dimension c 137 a shown in the backstory revealed in rickmurai jack the fate of this bethmother is unkown beth drive a red honda civic beth is dan harmonfavorite character her husbandname jerry is derived from the hebrew word jeroboam meaning large wine bottle amusingly this could be a hint that she married to the wine bottle in more than one sense she is a functioning alcoholic and married to jerry her full name might be lizbeth doing her name a lizbeth sanchez or lizbeth smith she is the biological daughter of replacement dimension rick of whom she wasn t aware had died until solaricks currently rick c 137 and cronenberged dimension morty stand in a her father and son respectively it is revealed in the same episode that her husband jerry is also from another dimension though from which is unknown it is revealed in star mort rickturn of the jerri that beth wa cloned by rick after the abcof beth the other beth had been living in outer space going on her own adventure much like her father rick insists he doesn t know which is the cloned beth a he intentionally erased his own memory and thus it remains unclear a to which beth is the original jerry speculates beth may have half sibling due to her fatherpromiscuous lifestyle this later proved true because of rick having a child with poñeta beth ha appeared in every episode except for m night shaym alien mortynight run the rick must be crazy forgetting sarick mortshall and rick a mort well

daughter summerbeth drink wine with a tearbeth with her husband son and grandsonbeth at the wedding of birdperson and tammybeth with her tabletbeth with a riflebeth scream while being attacked by a homeless manbeth after rick tell her shenot a clone behind the scene dan harmon ha frequently offered insight into bethcharacterisation since early around the release of the first season observing that it is beth whose behavior enables rick to be able to take morty on their adventure oh my god beth is so messed up i guess i know more about her than what you ve learned so far but you know she got pregnant at seventeen you know the guy that knocked her up wouldn t have been her first choice you know her motherout of the picture but that her dad who wa out of the picture when she wa a child is now back in the picture and that unlike jerry she seems relatively fine with his influence on her learning disabled son it seems like she d rather her son risk his life with her insane father than end up being like her husband thatreally really fucked up we know that kid blame themselves for their parent breaking up thatpretty standard psychology but from there we have different mechanism for coping with the blame and one of the strategy we see people employ in the face of an absentee parent is a deification of the parent that take le responsibility beth think her dad is better than her mother because her dad had the brain and gut to leave her thatreally really fucked up rickdaughter is more fucked up than rick and fucked up because of rick don t you worry about that i wa like why would that be the case why would any parent let this crazy man disappear through clearly dangerous portal with their son and after talking about it with justin for a while i realized the most important thing about that show for me which is that rick left at one point in bethchildhood and beth blamed her mother for rickabsence kid can sometimes idolize their worst parent and blame their supportive parent for chasing off the dad with the gut to leave sometimes they don t even admit it to themselves but they say my dadso fucking cool he got the fuck out of here and my momsuch a bitch shealways asking me to clean my room thatwhy dad left she probably asked him to clean his room and in bethcase shea horse heart surgeon shenot a real surgeon shea horse heart surgeon because she got pregnant at 17 and she fetishizes exceptionality she belief that rick a crazy a he is is the better of her two parent even though she wa raised by her mother and she blame her motherunremarkability on her fatherdeparture and will do anything to keep her father back in her life and if morty need to risk his life traipsing across the galaxy with her insane alcoholic father itbetter than morty growing up in safety and ending up like her mother or her husband jerry who she considers to be unremarkable and unredemptive and therefore undeserving of her affection so the center of the show even though we don t address it at all is this really fucked up woman who i love more than any character on that show because she would have been a brain surgeon but she got pregnant at 17 and so shedefensive about how shea horse heart surgeon because it take le school to do that and sheselfish and shecold but shesmart she wear the pant in the family and shewitty and she doesn t like herself she bother to love her father and that keep everything feasible because otherwise it would all fall apart you d go why wouldn t anyone say stop doing that stop taking my son on these adventure the answer is because jerry is terrified that beth will leave him and beth is terrified that rick will leave her and round and round we go and so we have this beautiful suspension that could provide u with hundred of episode separation from jerry is a blessing and curse for her she ha been defining her life by her marriage straight out of high school to this unremarkable man that she in her mind compare to her mother while fetishising exceptionality in the form of her father that excuse being removed it just allows u to put the spotlight on beth a little bit and start asking a few more question about her
